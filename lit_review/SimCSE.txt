A supervised and unsupervised approach are proposed. 

Found Success on STS-B when applying independent, random masking on the model for each sentence. To clarify, each sentence is its own positive, and other sentences are used as negatives.

The public model is primarily trained on a variety of supervised similarity tasks.
