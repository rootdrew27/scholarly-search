## Step 1: Introduction
### Abstract
Vision transformers (ViT) have revolutionized the field of computer vision by introducing a new paradigm for image understanding. Unlike traditional convolutional neural networks (CNNs), ViT models process images as a sequence of patches, leveraging the power of transformers to learn spatial hierarchies of visual features. This paper aims to provide a comprehensive overview of how ViT models work and their impact on the upscaling of image resolution.

## Step 2: Architecture Overview
### 2.1. Patch Embedding
The first step in a ViT model is to split the input image into a sequence of non-overlapping patches. Each patch is then embedded into a higher-dimensional space using a learnable linear layer. This process is known as patch embedding.

### 2.2. Positional Encoding
To maintain the spatial relationships between patches, ViT models use positional encoding, which adds a sinusoidal function of position to each patch embedding. This allows the model to learn spatial hierarchies of visual features.

### 2.3. Transformer Encoder
The patch embeddings are then fed into a transformer encoder, which consists of a series of identical layers. Each layer consists of a multi-head self-attention mechanism, followed by a feed-forward neural network (FFNN).

## Step 3: Self-Attention Mechanism
### 3.1. Query, Key, and Value
The self-attention mechanism in ViT models is based on the query, key, and value (QKV) framework. Each patch embedding is used as a query, key, and value to compute the attention weights.

### 3.2. Attention Weights
The attention weights are computed as the dot product of the query and key, divided by the square root of the key's dimensionality. This process is known as scaled dot-product attention.

### 3.3. Output
The output of the self-attention mechanism is a weighted sum of the value, where the weights are the attention weights.

## Step 4: Upscaling
### 4.1. Bilinear Interpolation
To upscale the image resolution, ViT models use bilinear interpolation to estimate the values of the upsampled pixels. This involves interpolating the values of the surrounding pixels.

### 4.2. Upsampling Layer
The upsampled pixels are then fed into an upsampling layer, which consists of a series of convolutional layers.

## Step 5: Conclusion
In conclusion, vision transformers have revolutionized the field of computer vision by introducing a new paradigm for image understanding. The self-attention mechanism in ViT models allows them to learn spatial hierarchies of visual features, making them effective for image classification and object detection tasks. The upscaling of image resolution is achieved through bilinear interpolation and an upsampling layer.
