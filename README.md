Test 1
- Prepare 10 unbiased questions and 10 (or more semi-biased questions)
- label 10-50 documents as answering one or more of these questions.
- Determine a cut-off for similarity score. The final model will be expected to beat this score when determining the similarity between an LLM's output and the correct document(s).


Test 2
- Have unbiased users prompt our application with a question (related to computer science research). 
- The user will look at the top 5 results returned and rate each one (0-3) in terms of the relevancy, where 0 is not relevant, 1 is not very relevant, 2 is somewhat relevant, and 3 is relevant.
