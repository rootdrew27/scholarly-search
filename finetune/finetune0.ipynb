Since multipath fading channels and OFDM blocks can be represented as differentiable layers, ML-based wireless systems are trained end-to-end.As such, JSCC can be built without modifying standard radio hardware (e.g., field test 6G with JSCC on 4G LTE).

To achieve this, the video JSCC adopts the temporal coding structure, which clusters each consecutive sequence of pictures into a group of pictures (GOP).
