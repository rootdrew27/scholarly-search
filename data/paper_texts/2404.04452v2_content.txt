SECTION: Vision Transformers in Domain Adaptation and Domain Generalization: A study of Robustness
Deep learning models are often evaluated in scenarios where the data distribution is different from those used in the training and validation phases. The discrepancy presents a challenge for accurately predicting the performance of models once deployed on the target distribution. Domain adaptation and generalization are widely recognized as effective strategies for addressing such shifts, thereby ensuring reliable performance. The recent promising results in applying vision transformers in computer vision tasks, coupled with advancements in self-attention mechanisms, have demonstrated their significant potential for robustness and generalization in handling distribution shifts. Motivated by the increased interest from the research community, our paper investigates the deployment of vision transformers in domain adaptation and domain generalization scenarios. For domain adaptation methods, we categorize research into feature-level, instance-level, model-level adaptations, and hybrid approaches, along with other categorizations with respect to diverse strategies for enhancing domain adaptation. Similarly, for domain generalization, we categorize research into multi-domain learning, meta-learning, regularization techniques, and data augmentation strategies. We further classify diverse strategies in research, underscoring the various approaches researchers have taken to address distribution shifts by integrating vision transformers. The inclusion of comprehensive tables summarizing these categories is a distinct feature of our work, offering valuable insights for researchers. These findings highlight the versatility of vision transformers in managing distribution shifts, crucial for real-world applications, especially in critical safety and decision-making scenarios.

SECTION: Introduction
Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) are a cornerstone of computer vision algorithms, largely owing to their proficiency in managing spatial relationships and maintaining invariance to input translations. Their widespread success in object recognition tasks can be attributed to advantageous inductive biases, such as translation equivalence, which enable them to effectively identify and process visual patterns. The foundational concept of using convolutions in neural networks was initiated by Fukushima’s development of the Neocognitron, a model that introduced the idea of a shift-invariant architecture. This idea was further advanced by LeCun et al., who applied gradient-based learning to document recognition, showcasing the practical applicability of CNNs. The significant breakthrough in CNNs came with Krizhevsky et al., whose work on ImageNet classification popularized deep convolutional networks. Following this, developments such as Szegedy et al.’s deeper convolutional networks, He et al.’s introduction of residual networks, and Huang et al.’s densely connected networkshave each contributed unique architectural improvements that enhance model robustness and accuracy. Recent studies like those by Hsieh et al.and Tan and Lecontinue to explore the limits of CNN efficiency and robustness, further solidifying the central role of convolutional layers in modern vision networks. These convolutional layers have been further improved with innovations such as residual connections. Extensive use has led to detailed empiricaland analytical evaluations of convolutional networks.

Recent advancements, however, have shown the potential of transformers regarding to their self-attention mechanisms that find the global features of the data which provide a more holistic view of the data, reduce inductive bias, and exhibit a high degree of scalability and flexibility. These factors collectively enhance the model’s ability to generalize better during testing.
After their tremendous success in Natural Language Processing (NLP) tasks, transformers are now being actively integrated into computer vision tasks. Pioneering works like Vaswani et al.introduced transformers, showcasing their efficiency in handling long-range dependencies in data. This approach was extended to language understanding by Devlin et al.with BERT, which dramatically improved the performance of NLP tasks. Brown et al.further demonstrated the capability of transformers in NLP with their few-shot learning approaches. In the realm of computer vision, Chen et al.and Dosovitskiy et al.adapted transformer architectures to manage spatial hierarchies in images, leading to significant advancements in image segmentation and recognition tasks. Touvron et al.explored training data-efficient image transformers, which optimize the transformer architecture for better performance with limited data. Khan et al.provided a comprehensive survey on the application of transformers in vision, encapsulating various models and methodologies that have evolved over time. Adaptformer by Chen et al.adapts ViTs for scalable visual recognition, enhancing their adaptability and efficiency across different scales. In terms of integrating vision and language tasks, works like VideoBERT by Sun et al.and ViLBERT by Lu et al.have been foundational, developing joint models that learn correlated features between video and text. LXMERT by Tan et al.and UNITER by Chen et al.further refine these approaches, improving the cross-modal understanding necessary for complex tasks involving both vision and language. Finally, Radford et al.explored the use of transformers to develop visual models that can be trained using only natural language descriptions, rather than traditional image labels. This approach leverages the rich contextual information available in language to enhance the model’s ability to understand and generalize across different visual and textual modalities. By doing so, they are advancing the capacity of models to perform tasks in more diverse and complex environments, effectively bridging the gap between vision and language.

Vision Transformers (ViT), stands out as a key development in this area, applying a self-attention-based mechanism to sequences of image patches. It achieves competitive performance on the challenging ImageNet classification task, compared to CNNs. Researchers discovered that existing CNN architectures exhibit limited generalization capabilities when confronted with distribution shift scenarios. Subsequent research, as seen in works like, has further expanded the capabilities of transformers, demonstrating impressive performance across various visual benchmarks. This includes applications in different benchmarks including COCO (Common Objects in Context) dataset in object detection and instance segmentation, as well as ADE20K dataset for semantic segmentation.

As ViTs gain popularity, it becomes crucial to examine the characteristics of the representations they learn. This is important in areas like autonomous driving, robotics, and healthcare, where the trustworthy and reliability of these systems are crucial. Recent studies delve into evaluating ViTs’ robustness, focusing not just on standard metrics like accuracy and computational cost, but also on their intrinsic impact on model robustness and generalization, especially in handling Distribution Shifts. In conventional training and testing scenarios, it is assumed that data are independent and identically distributed (IID). However, this assumption often doesn’t reflect real-world scenarios. Therefore, exploring the potential of ViTs as the modern vision networks, to adapt to target domains, and generalize and perform well on unseen data, becomes a crucial aspect of machine learning models.

Recognizing the unique capabilities of ViTs in modern vision tasks highlights the need to assess their performance across varied conditions. In traditional deep learning training and testing scenarios, there is a common assumption that the data are independent and identically distributed (IID). However, any shift in data distribution or domain after training can reduce testing performance. Such IID assumptions often fall short in real-world scenarios, where distribution shifts are prevalent. Thus, the ability of deep learning models to generalize and retain performance across different test domains is crucial for determining their effectiveness. Exploring the adaptability of ViTs necessitates revisitingand, which are fundamental strategies in machine learning aimed at addressing the challenges posed by distribution shifts between training and testing data, especially when these shifts are pronounced. Although DA and DG have been traditionally used to overcome such challenges, applying these strategies within the advanced framework of ViTs offers a new approach to examine how these innovative models manage and excel distribution shifts. DA, which provides access to the target domain, and DG, where the target domain remains unseen, represent two approaches to this issue. DA seeks to minimize the discrepancy between specific source and target domains, while DG strives to create a model that remains effective across various unseen domains by utilizing the diversity of multiple source domains during training. This often includes the development of domain-agnostic features that are effective across various domains.

Building on this foundation, research efforts have been directed at enhancing ViTs’ generalization capabilities through various methodologies, delving into both DA and DG strategies, and integrating ViTs into the broader deep learning framework. Comparative analyses of ViTs and high-performing CNNs reveal distinct advantages attributable to ViTs. A key differentiation is the dynamic nature of weight computation in ViTs through the self-attention mechanism, contrasting with the static weights learned by CNNs during training. This attribute provides ViTs with a more flexible and adaptable ability. ViTs employ multi-head self-attention to intricately parse and interpret contextual information within images, thereby excelling in scenarios involving occlusions, domain variations, and perturbations. They demonstrate remarkable robustness, effectively maintaining accuracy despite image modifications. Furthermore, ViTs exhibit a reduced texture bias compared to CNNs, favoring shape recognition which aligns more closely with human visual processing. This proficiency in discerning overall shapes facilitates accurate image categorization without relying on detailed, pixel-level analysis. ViTs’ ability to merge various features for image classification enhances their performance across diverse datasets, proving advantageous in both conventional and few-shot learning settings where the model is trained with only a few examples. Refer to Figurefor the challenges prevalent in images. These challenges include severe occlusions, adversarial perturbations, patch permutations, and domain shifts effectively addressed through the flexibility and dynamic receptive fields of self-attention mechanisms. Unlike CNNs, which primarily focus on texture, ViTs concentrate more on object shape, enhancing their resistance to texture shifts and benefiting shape recognition, and they are adept at propagating spatial information, an advantage for tasks such as detection and segmentation.

In our comprehensive review, the first of its kind to explore the potential of ViTs in DA and DG scenarios, we have meticulously examined how ViTs adapt to distribution shifts. This study delves into the fundamentals, architecture, and key components of ViTs, offering a unique categorization and analysis of their role in both the theoretical aspects and practical implementations of DA and DG. In this review paper, we explored all the existing papers in this field and developed our own categorizations for the research. Within the context of DA, we categorized the research into feature-level, instance-level, model-level, and hybrid approaches. For DG, our categorization includes multi-domain learning, meta-learning approaches, regularization techniques, and data augmentation strategies.
After the first categorization, we found that there are many studies using ViTs in different categories for DA and DG. The research is somewhat sparse, with researchers applying these modern vision networks in various DA and DG strategies, making it challenging to categorize this diverse research. To address this, we introduced another categorization, providing tables including each study that use different methods. We defined the methods they are using and then, for each study, specified these methods. This dual categorization approach is particularly useful because most of the research employs hybrid methods.
A significant portion of our review is dedicated to showcasing the applications of ViTs beyond image recognition, such as semantic segmentation, action recognition, face analysis, medical imaging, and other emerging fields. This broad spectrum of applications highlights the versatility and potential of ViTs across the vast landscape of computer vision. In our discussion section, we delve into the initial development challenges associated with ViTs, aiming to equip researchers with insightful findings that could steer the direction of future investigations in this area. Furthermore, we outline prospective research paths.

As the field of computer vision advances, especially with the introduction of ViTs, this survey emerges as a promising source for researchers and practitioners alike. We aspire that our findings will stimulate further investigation and innovation in leveraging ViTs for Domain Adaptation and Generalization, thereby overcoming current hurdles and paving new paths in this ever-evolving research domain.

SECTION: Vision Transformers: Fundamentals and Architecture
The transformer model, initially applied in the field of natural language processing (NLP) for machine translation tasks, consists of an encoder and a decoder. Both the encoder and the decoder are composed of multiple transformer blocks, each having an identical architecture. Figureillustrates the basic configuration of ViTs. The encoder is responsible for generating encodings of the input. In contrast, the decoder leverages the contextual information embedded within these encodings to generate the output sequence. Each transformer block within the model encompasses several components: a multi-head attention layer, a feed-forward neural network, residual connections, and layer normalization.

SECTION: Overview of the Vision Transformers Architecture
The advancements in basic transformer models are largely due to their two main components. The first is the self-attention mechanism, which excels in capturing long-range dependencies among sequence elements. This surpasses the limitations of traditional recurrent models in encoding such relationships. The second key component is the transformer encoder layers. These layers are pivotal in hierarchical representation learning within transformer models, as they integrate self-attention with feed-forward networks. This integration enables effective feature extraction and information propagation throughout the model.

The self-attention mechanism assesses the importance or relevance of each patch in a sequence in relation to others. For instance, in language processing, it can identify words that are likely to co-occur in a sentence. As a fundamental part of transformers, self-attention captures the interactions among all elements in a sequence, which is especially beneficial for tasks that involve structured predictions. A self-attention layer updates each sequence element by aggregating information from the entire input sequence.

Let’s denote a sequence ofentitiesby, whereis the embedding dimension for each entity. The goal of self-attention is to capture the relationships among all the entities by encoding each entity based on the overall contextual information. To achieve this, it employs three learnable weight matrices: Queries, Keys, and Values, where=. By projecting the input sequenceonto these weight matrices, it obtains,, and. The self-attention layer outputs, calculated as:

To determine the importance or weight of each value in the sequence, a softmax function is applied. This function assigns weights to the values based on their relevance or significance within the context of the task or model.
In summary, the self-attention mechanism enables each element in the sequence to be updated based on its interactions with other elements, incorporating global contextual information. The self-attention mechanism computes the dot product between the query and all the keys for a specific entity in the sequence. These dot products are then normalized using the softmax function, resulting in attention scores. Each entity in the sequence is then updated as a weighted sum of all the entities, with the weights determined by the attention scores. We will delve deeper into scaled dot-product attention and its application within multi-head attention in the following section..

The encoder is composed of a sequence of identical layers, with a total oflayers, whereis specified in Figure. Each layer comprises two principal sub-layers: a multi-head self-attention mechanism and a position-wise fully connected feed-forward network. Subsequent to each layer, the architecture employs residual connectionsand layer normalization. This configuration stands in contrast to CNNs, in which feature aggregation and transformation are executed concurrently. Within the transformer architecture, these operations are distinctly partitioned: the self-attention sub-layer is tasked with aggregation exclusively, whereas the feed-forward sub-layer focuses on the transformation of features.

The decoder is structured similarly, consisting of identical layers. Each layer within the decoder encompasses three sub-layers. The initial two sub-layers, specifically the multi-head self-attention and the feed-forward networks, reflect the architecture of the encoder. The third sub-layer introduces a novel multi-head attention mechanism that targets the outputs from the corresponding encoder layer, as depicted in Figure-b.

SECTION: Key Components and Building Blocks of Vision Transformers
The subsequent sections will provide in-depth explanations of the key components and fundamental building blocks of ViTs. These include patch extraction and embedding, positional encoding, multi-head self-attention, and feed-forward networks. In patch extraction, an image is divided into smaller patches, each of which is then transformed into a numerical representation through an embedding process. Positional encoding is employed to incorporate spatial information, allowing the model to account for the relative positions of these patches. The multi-head self-attention mechanism is crucial for capturing dependencies and contextual relationships within the image. Finally, the feed-forward networks are responsible for introducing non-linear transformations, enhancing the model’s ability to process complex visual information.

A pure transformer model can be directly employed for image classification tasks by operating on sequences of image patches. This approach adheres closely to the original design of the transformer. To handleimages, the input imageis reshaped into a sequence of flattened 2D patches, whererepresents the number of channels. The original image resolution is denoted as, whilesignifies the resolution of each image patch. The effective sequence length for the transformer is defined as. Given that the transformer employs consistent dimensions across its layers, a trainable linear projection is applied to map each vectorized patch to the model dimension. This output is referred to as patch embedding.

To optimize the model’s use of sequence order, integrating information about the tokens’ relative or absolute positions is essential. This is accomplished through the addition of positional encoding to the input embeddings at the foundation of both the encoder and decoder stacks. These positional encodings, matching the dimensionalityof the embeddings, are merged with the input embeddings. Positional encoding can be generated through various methods, including both learned and fixed strategies. The precise technique for embedding positional information is delineated by the equations that follow:

In the given equations,represents the position of a word within a sentence, andrefers to the current dimension of the positional encoding. In this manner, the positional encoding in the transformer model assigns a sinusoidal value to each element. This enables the model to learn relative positional relationships and generalize to longer sequences during inference. In addition to the fixed positional encoding employed in the original transformer, other models have explored the use of learned positional encodingand relative positional encoding.

The multi-head attention mechanism enables the model to capture multiple complex relationships among different elements in the sequence. It achieves this by utilizing several self-attention blocks, each with its own set of weight matrices. The outputs of these blocks are combined and projected onto a weight matrix to obtain a comprehensive representation of the input sequence.
The original transformer model employs h = 8 blocks. Each block has its own distinct set of learnable weight matrices, denoted asfor. When given an input X, the output of the h self-attention blocks in the multi-head attention is concatenated into a single matrix. This concatenated matrix is then projected on to a weight matrix. Refer to Figurefor a visual overview of the Scaled Dot-Product Attention and its extension into Multi-Head Attention, fundamental mechanisms for contextual processing in transformer architectures. The diagram details the flow from input queries to the final attention output.

Self-attention differs from convolutional operations in that it calculates filters dynamically rather than relying on static filters. Unlike convolution, self-attention is invariant to permutations and changes in the number of input points, allowing it to handle irregular inputs effectively. It has been shown in research that self-attention, when used with positional encodings, offers greater flexibility and can effectively capture local features similar to convolutional models. Further investigations have been conducted to analyze the relationship between self-attention and convolution operations. Empirical evidence supports the notion that multi-head self-attention, with sufficient parameters, serves as a more general operation that can encompass the expressiveness of convolution. In fact, self-attention possesses the capability to learn both global and local features, enabling it to adaptively determine kernel weights and adjust the receptive field, similar to deformable convolutions. This demonstrates the versatility and effectiveness of self-attention in capturing diverse aspects of data.

In both the encoder and decoder, a feed-forward network (FFN) follows the self-attention layers. This network incorporates two linear transformation layers and a nonlinear activation function within them. Denoted as the function, it can be expressed as, whereandare the parameter matrices of the linear transformation layers, andrepresents the chosen nonlinear activation function, such as GELU.

SECTION: Training process of Vision Transformers
Self-attention-based transformer models have revolutionized machine learning through their extensive pre-training on large datasets. This pre-training stage employs a variety of learning approaches, including supervised, unsupervised, and self-supervised methods. Such methodologies have been explored in the seminal works of Dosovitskiy et al., Devlin et al., Li et al., and Lin et al.. The primary goal of this phase is to acclimate the model to a broad spectrum of data, or to a combination of different datasets. This strategy aims to establish a foundational understanding of visual information processing, a concept further elucidated by Su et al.and Chen et al..

After pre-training, these models undergo fine-tuning with more specialized datasets, which vary in size. This step is crucial for tailoring the model to specific applications, such as image classification, object detection, and action recognition, thereby improving their performance and accuracy in these tasks.

The value of pre-training is particularly evident in large-scale transformer models utilized across both language and vision domains. For instance, the Vision Transformer (ViT) model exhibits a marked decline in performance when trained exclusively on the ImageNet dataset, as opposed to including pre-training on the more comprehensive JFT-300M dataset, which boasts over 300 million images. While pre-training on such extensive datasets significantly boosts model performance, it introduces a practical challenge: manually labeling vast datasets is both labor-intensive and costly.

This challenge leads researchers to the pivotal role of self-supervised learning (SSL) in developing scalable and efficient transformer models. SSL emerges as an effective strategy by using unlabeled data, thereby avoiding the limitations associated with extensive manual annotation. Through SSL, models undertake pretext tasks that generate pseudo-labels from the data itself, fostering a foundational understanding of data patterns and features without the necessity for explicit labeling. This method not only enhances the model’s ability to discern crucial features and patterns, pivotal for downstream tasks with limited labeled data but also maximizes the utility of the vast volumes of unlabeled data available.

Contrastive learning, a subset of SSL, exemplifies this by focusing on identifying minor semantic differences in images, which significantly sharpens the model’s semantic discernment. The transition from traditional pre-training methods to SSL underscores a paradigm shift in how models are trained, moving from reliance on extensive, manually labeled datasets to an innovative use of unlabeled data. This shift not only addresses the scalability and resource challenges but also enhances the generalizability and efficiency of transformer networks.

Khan et al.categorize SSL methods based on their pretext tasks into generative, context-based, and cross-modal approaches. Generative methods focus on creating images or videos that match the original data distribution, teaching the model to recognize data patterns. Context-based methods use spatial or temporal relationships within the data, enhancing contextual understanding. Cross-modal methods exploit correspondences between different data types, like image-text or audio-video, for a more comprehensive data understanding.

Generative approaches, especially those involving masked image modeling, train models to reconstruct missing or obscured parts of images, thereby refining their generative skills. Other SSL strategies include image colorization, image super-resolution, image in-painting, and approaches using GAN networks. Context-based SSL approaches deal with tasks like solving image patch jigsaw puzzles, classifying masked objects, predicting geometric transformations like rotations, and verifying the chronological sequence of video frames. Finally, cross-modal SSL methods focus on aligning different modalities, ensuring correspondences between elements such as text and image, audio and video, or RGB and flow information.

SECTION: Advantages of Vision Transformers compared to CNNs backbones
The advent of ViTs represents a significant innovation in the field of image processing, offering substantial benefits over traditional CNNs like ResNet. These advantages are succinctly demonstrated which underscores the key distinctions and superiorities of ViTs:

ViTs have been effectively adapted for a broad range of vision recognition tasks, demonstrating significant enhancements over CNNs. These advancements are particularly pronounced in tasks such as classification on the ImageNet dataset, object detection, and semantic segmentation, areas where ViTs have outperformed established benchmarks. Remarkably, ViTs have also shown the capability to achieve competitive results with architectures that are smaller in size, highlighting their efficiency and scalability. Furthermore, the overall improvements brought by ViTs in the vision domain are supported by comprehensive analyses and comparisons.

The attention mechanism within ViTs effectively captures long-range dependencies in the input data. This modeling of inter-token relationships facilitates a more comprehensive global context, representing a significant advancement beyond the local processing capabilities of CNNsand more recent works. Additionally, the attention mechanism provides insight into the focus areas of the model during input processing, acting as a built-in saliency map.

ViTs have proven to be highly versatile, serving as a backbone that surpasses previous benchmarks with their dynamic inference capabilities. They are particularly adept at handling unordered and unstructured point sets, making them suitable for a broader range of applications.

The ability of ViTs to integrate text and visual data facilitates an unparalleled understanding of the dependencies between different tasks, effectively harnessing the synergy between diverse data types. Although CNNs can be adapted for text-visual fusion—potentially with the assistance of Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs), ViTs excel in this area. This superiority stems from ViTs’ inherent design, which naturally accommodates the parallel processing of complex, multimodal datasets. Unlike CNNs, which may require additional mechanisms or complex architectures to achieve similar integrations, ViTs directly leverage their attention mechanisms to dynamically weigh the importance of different data elements.

The architecture of ViTs facilitates end-to-end training for tasks such as object detection, streamlining the training process by obviating the need for complex post-processing steps.

In essence, ViTs offer a powerful modeling approach that is well-suited to extracting meaningful information from vast and varied input data. These visualizations depict how each network type processes and identifies areas of focus within the image. The attention maps from the ViT show distinct patterns indicating specific regions the model attends to when making predictions, while the feature maps from the ResNet indicate more dispersed and convolutionally derived features throughout the image.

SECTION: Vision Transformers in Domain Adaptation and Domain Generalization
ViTs have shown promising performance in computer vision tasks. In this section, we focus on exploring the potential of adapting ViT to DA and DG scenarios to mitigate the distribution shifts.

Recent studies have demonstrated that leveraging ViTs backbones as the feature extractors offers superior capability in managing distribution shifts compared to conventional CNN architectures. This superiority is relevant for practical applications where adapting to varied data distributions is important. These works have led researchers to develop multi-modal approaches in DA and DG scenarios, integrating diverse strategies to further enhance the adaptability and generalization capabilities of ViTs. These approaches often involve the strategic selection of different models and integrating them and carefully chosen loss functions, aimed at regularizing the training of multi-modals designs.

In the following sections of our paper, we aim to provide an in-depth analysis of these methodologies and their implications in the field of computer vision. This will include detailed discussions on the specific techniques and innovations that have enhanced the performance of ViTs in regard to distribution shifts. Figureillustrates the categorization of the research we have reviewed for this paper, highlighting the respective approaches within DA and DG methods. In the upcoming sections, we aim to provide a more comprehensive explanation of the methods employed.

SECTION: Vision Transformers in Domain Adaptation
DA is a critical area of research within machine learning that aims to improve model performance on a target domain by leveraging knowledge from a source domain, especially when the data distribution differs between these domains. This discrepancy, known as a distribution shift, poses significant challenges to the adapting of models across varied application scenarios. DA techniques are designed to mitigate these challenges by adapting models to perform well on data that was not seen during training, thereby enhancing model robustness and generalizability.

Utilizing ViTs to address distribution shifts within the framework of DA approaches., offer novel methods to model robustness and generalizability in diverse application scenarios. In the majority of studies exploring the application of ViTs to address the challenges of distribution shifts within DA strategies, the primary emphasis has been on unsupervised domain adaptation (UDA). DA strategies in the context of ViTs can be broadly classified into several categories, each contributing uniquely to the model’s adaptability to different target domains. Our categorization are based on feature-level adaptation, instance-level adaptation, model-level adaptation, and hybrid approaches. In each of these categories, we further elaborate on the adaptation level, providing insights into their architecture, and efficacy in DA scenarios.

Feature-level adaptation involves aligning the feature distributions between the source and target domains to ensure that the features learned by the model in the source domain are applicable to the target domain. This approach is particularly effective in addressing the domain shift problem by transforming the feature space of the source domain to closely match that of the target domain. Techniques such as Domain-Oriented Transformer (DOT), TRANS-DA, and Spectral UDA (SUDA) have shown promising results by employing various strategies like adversarial training, feature matching, and domain-specific normalization. By aligning feature distributions, these methods help to reduce the discrepancy between domains, thereby improving the model’s performance on the target domain.Researchers proposed a Domain-Oriented Transformer to address the challenges faced by conventional UDA techniques for domain discrepancies. Traditional methods often encounter difficulties when attempting to align domains, which can compromise the discriminability of the target domain when classifiers are biased towards the source data. To overcome these limitations, DOT employs feature alignment across two distinct spaces, each specifically designed for one of the domains. It leverages separate classification tokens and classifiers for each domain. This approach ensures the preservation of domain-specific discriminability while effectively capturing both domain-invariant and domain-specific information. It achieves this through a combination of contrastive-based alignment and source-guided pseudo-label. The novel DOT method is introduced in.

TRANS-DA, focuses on generating pseudo-labels with reduced noise and retraining the model using new images composed of patches from both source and target domains. This approach includes a cross-domain alignment loss for better matching centroids of labeled and pseudo-labeled patches, aiming to improve domain adaptation. It falls into the feature-level adaptation category, as it focuses on refining feature representations and aligning them across domains.
Another study shifts focus to integrating transformers with CNN-backbones, proposing Domain-Transformer for UDA. This approach, distinct from existing methods that rely heavily on local interactions among image patches, introduces a plug-and-play domain-level attention mechanism. This mechanism emphasizes transferable features by ensuring local semantic consistency across domains, leveraging domain-level attention and manifold regularization.

Spectral UDA (SUDA), is an innovative UDA technique in spectral space. SUDA introduces a Spectrum Transformer (ST) for mitigating inter-domain discrepancies and a multi-view spectral learning approach for learning diverse target representations. The paper’s approach emphasizes feature-level adaptation, focusing on learning domain-invariant spectral features efficiently and effectively across various visual tasks such as image classification, segmentation, and object detection.
Inthe Semantic Aware Message Broadcasting (SAMB) is introduced to enhance feature alignment in UDA. This approach challenges the effectiveness of using just one global class token in ViTs. It suggests adding group tokens instead. These tokens focus on broadcasting messages to different semantic regions, thereby enriching domain alignment features. Additionally, the study explores the impact of adversarial-based feature alignment and pseudo-label based self-training on UDA, proposing a two-stage training strategy that enhances the adaptation capability of the ViT.

Gao et al. inaddresses the Test Time Adaptation (TTA) challenge for adapting to target data and avoiding performance degradation due to distribution shifts. By introducing Data-efficient Prompt Tuning (DePT), the approach combines visual prompts in ViTs with source-initialized prompt fine-tuning. This fine-tuning, paired with a memory bank-based online pseudo-labeling and hierarchical self-supervised regularization, enables efficient model adjustment to the target domain, even with minimal data. DePT’s adaptability extends to online or multi-source TTA settings. Furthermore, CTTAproposes a unique approach to continual TTA using visual domain prompts. It presents a lightweight, image-level adaptation strategy, where visual prompts are dynamically added to input images, adapting them to the source domain model. This approach mitigates error accumulation and catastrophic forgetting by focusing on input modification rather than model tuning, a significant shift from traditional model-dependent methods. This method can be classified as a feature-level adaptation, as it primarily focuses on adjusting the input image features for domain adaptation without altering the underlying model architecture.

Instance-level adaptation involves selecting or weighting specific data points (instances) more heavily during training to ensure that the model learns features relevant to the target domain. This approach can significantly improve the model’s performance on the target domain by prioritizing instances that reflect the characteristics of the target data. Techniques such as Source Free Open Set Domain Adaptation (SF-OSDA), style-based data augmentation, and clustering are commonly used in instance-level adaptation to refine and enhance the training process. By focusing on relevant instances, these methods help to reduce the impact of domain shift and improve the model’s generalization capabilities.

One notable instance of instance-level adaptation is addressed in the study by, which deals with the challenge of Source Free Open Set Domain Adaptation. This scenario involves adapting a pre-trained model, initially trained on an inaccessible source dataset, to an unlabeled target dataset that includes open set samples, or data points that do not belong to any class seen during training. The primary technique involves leveraging a self-supervised ViT, which learns directly from the target domain to distill knowledge. A crucial element of their method is a unique style-based data augmentation technique, designed to enhance the training of the ViT within the target domain by providing a richer, more contextually diverse set of training data. This leads to the creation of embeddings with rich contextual information.

The model uses these information-rich embeddings to cluster target images based on semantic similarities and assigns them weak pseudo-labels with associated uncertainty levels. To improve the accuracy of these pseudo-labels, the researchers introduce a metric called Cluster Relative Maximum Logit Score (CRMLS). This measure adjusts the confidence levels of the pseudo-labels, making them more reliable. Additionally, the approach calculates weighted class prototypes within this enriched embedding space, facilitating the effective adaptation of the source model to the target domain, thus exemplifying an application of instance-level adaptation techniques.

Model-level adaptation involves developing specialized ViT architectures or modifying existing models to enhance their adaptability to domain shifts. This approach focuses on adapting the internal structure of the model itself to better handle variations between the source and target domains. Techniques such as introducing new layers, modifying attention mechanisms, and designing domain-specific model components are commonly employed in model-level adaptation. These modifications enable the model to learn more robust and transferable features, improving its performance on the target domain.

Zhang et al. inprimarily focus on enhancing the out-of-distribution generalization of ViTs. It delves into techniques like adversarial learning, information theory, and self-supervised learning to improve model robustness against distribution shifts. The study is categorized into model-level adaptation, as it enhances the general model architecture and training process of ViTs to achieve better performance across varied distributions. Yang et alintroduce TransDA, a novel framework for source-free domain adaptation (SFDA), which integrates a transformer with a CNN to enhance focus on important object regions. Diverging from traditional SFDA approaches that primarily align cross-domain distributions, TransDA capitalizes on the initial influence of pre-trained source models on target outputs. By embedding the transformer as an attention module in the CNN, the model gains improved generalization capabilities for target domains. Additionally, the framework employs self-supervised knowledge distillation using target pseudo-labels to refine the transformer’s attention towards object regions. This approach effectively addresses the limitations of CNNs in handling significant domain shifts, which often lead to over-fitting and a lack of focus on relevant objects, therefore offering a more robust solution for domain adaptation challenges. In addressing the intricacies of model-level adaptation in DA, a series of innovative approaches emerge, each offering unique solutions to prevalent challenges.highlights the use of BeiT, a pre-trained transformer model, for UDA. The core idea is leveraging BeiT’s powerful feature extraction capabilities, initially trained on source datasets, and then adapting them to target datasets. This approach, which significantly outperforms existing methods in the ViSDA Challenge, primarily focuses on model-level adaptation. It utilizes the self-attention mechanism inherent in transformers to adapt to new, out-of-distribution target datasets, demonstrating a marked improvement in domain adaptation tasks. TFCaims to bridge this gap by demonstrating the potential of combining convolutional operations and transformer mechanisms for adversarial UDA through a hybrid network structure termed transformer fused convolution (TFC). By seamlessly integrating local and global features, TFC enhances the representation capacity for UDA and improves the differentiation between foreground and background elements. Additionally, to bolster TFC’s resilience, an uncertainty penalty loss is introduced, leading to the consistent assignment of lower scores to incorrect classes.

In our categorization of domain adaptation techniques, hybrid approaches combine multiple methods (feature-level, instance-level, and model-level) to leverage the strengths of each.

While many papers claim the superiority of ViTs over CNNs, a balanced perspective considering both architectures is essential, depending on their robustness and the features crucial for specific applications. This aspect was evident in our exploration of robustness, where different factors important in generalization and stability were considered, with ViTs sometimes outperforming CNNs in extracting certain features.

While ViTs face challenges stemming from various factors, they are on a trajectory of improvement, much like CNNs were in their early stages. There is a noticeable rise in publications dedicated to modern vision models, emphasizing the advancements being made. As highlighted earlier, the attention mechanism inherent in ViTs significantly enhances their proficiency in handling distribution shifts, marking an advantage over CNNs in this aspect.

In line with the focus of this study, this section outlines potential research areas in the field of tackling distribution shifts. The recommendations take into account the properties of ViTs, as well as DA and DG approaches for managing distribution shifts, and how they can be effectively integrated. ViTs have demonstrated the capacity to surpass previous state-of-the-art methods in certain contexts. However, their superiority in some tasks is not consistently overwhelming, partly due to their reliance on manually designed architectures, which may impede their adaptability, as explored by.

Despite the comprehensive nature of this review, it is noteworthy to mention the following limitations with respect to our research. Our review primarily focuses on studies using well-known benchmark datasets, which may limit the generalizability of our findings to other datasets and real-world scenarios not covered in the review. The datasets reviewed may not fully capture the diversity of real-world distribution shifts, potentially overlooking scenarios where ViTs might struggle. Additionally, the review is based on the current state of research, which may evolve with new methodologies and findings. Some promising methods might not have been included due to publication timing. Furthermore, while theoretical and experimental results are extensively reviewed, there is limited practical validation of ViTs in real-world applications within this paper. Certain assumptions were made regarding the performance and applicability of ViTs based on existing literature, which might not hold true in all practical scenarios.

In conclusion, this review not only aggregates and analyzes the role of ViTs within DA and DG frameworks but also outlines potential areas for future research, aimed at creating more robust and versatile deep learning models. As the first survey of its kind, it marks a significant step in understanding and advancing the capabilities of modern vision networks in handling distribution shifts, pointing towards a promising future in this dynamic field. Looking forward, the field faces substantial challenges such as the extensive data requirements and computational intensity of ViTs, alongside a need for real-world, application-specific datasets to validate new DA and DG approaches. To address these limitations and further enhance the applicability of ViTs, future research should focus on several key areas, including expanding the diversity of datasets used, improving practical validation in real-world applications, and keeping pace with evolving methodologies. In the following subsections, we will detail the challenges and outline future research directions accordingly.

SECTION: Data Requirements and Computational Intensity
Upon investigating the deployment of ViTs within the realms of DA and DG methods, our research has identified a range of challenges that merit closer examination. ViTs have emerged as a pivotal enhancement in computer vision capabilities, promising significant advances across various applications. However, their adoption in real-world scenarios is fraught by considerable challenges, primarily due to their extensive data requirements. The necessity for large-scale datasets, such as JFT-300M, for effective training, underscores this challenge, ashave pointed out. This substantial reliance on voluminous, pre-trained models, emphasized by, necessitates access to high-quality data, a critical aspect particularly when training ViTs from scratch on more constrained datasets, a scenario highlighted by, and recently discussed in. This dependency presents a significant barrier, wherein the effectiveness of ViTs, upon adaptation through transfer learning and fine-tuning, is closely linked to the quality of pre-existing object detectors. This necessitates a meticulous application of these methodologies, as evidenced by the works of,and scalable approaches like.
In addition, a big challenge is when the models need to learn from a very small number of examples, a method known as few-shot learning. Situations that require high safety standards or have very limited data, show how hard it can be to adjust ViTs under different conditions. Recently, new methods like source-free domain adaptation and test time adaptation have shown promise in making models more generalized. Even though researchers made progress in overcoming biases from the source data, they still have a lot to learn about how to manage uncertainty when making these adjustments. This area presents significant opportunities for further research.
Finally, the inherent self-attention mechanisms of ViTs, especially in models with a vast number of trainable parameters, introduce a layer of complexity that demands substantial computational resources. This further complicates their deployment in practical scenarios, as discussed by.

SECTION: Necessity of New Benchmarks
With respect to handling distribution shift approaches, they have presented their own set of challenges. The recent VisDA-2021 dataset competition, where transformers underpinned the winning solutions, indicates their efficacy in managing robustness against distribution shifts. This observation aligns with findings by, asserting transformers’ superior generalization capabilities on target domain samples. While the advancements in performance over conventional baseline backbones, such as CNNs, are commendable, the quest for perfection is ongoing and remains substantially unfulfilled. This gap underscores the necessity for new benchmarks aimed at propelling research on real-world distribution shift approaches further. The limited number of datasets currently employed in DA and DG intensifies the challenge of validating new approaches, highlighting a need for real-world, application-specific datasets. This review, although broad in scope, reveals a prevailing bias towards classification tasks, even when exploring applications beyond image recognition. In the domain of medical imaging, for instance, this bias persists, underscoring the importance of extending the focus of ViTs to encompass a wider array of tasks beyond mere classification tasks.

SECTION: Pre and Post Domain Adaptation Approaches
In the context of DA, the utilization of pre-domain adaptation (Pre-DA) and post-domain adaptation (Post-DA) strategies plays a pivotal role in enhancing model performance. Pre-DA focuses on preparing models before they are exposed to new domains, aiming to address and bridge domain discrepancies beforehand. Meanwhile, Post-DA strategies are applied after exposure to the new domain, with the goal of mitigating accuracy declines. The significance of integrating both Pre-DA and Post-DA approaches has been underscored in recent studies, suggesting that a comprehensive exploration of these strategies could substantially improve the adaptability and effectiveness of models in unfamiliar domains.
Another significant challenge is the lack of effective comparison metrics for certain DA and DG scenarios. The common use of absolute mean Average Precision (mAP) for object detection tasks does not fully capture the subtleties of evaluation metrics, where relative improvements post-DA might be more indicative of success. This highlights a need for robust comparison metrics capable of accommodating the variability inherent in models trained under diverse conditions.

SECTION: Uncertainty-Aware Vision Transformers
In our analysis of ViTs and their proficiency in navigating distribution shifts, we’ve highlighted their potential to enhance model generalization through various techniques. A particularly promising, yet under explored approach is integrating uncertainty quantification methods with ViTs. This integration enables models to provide predictions along with confidence levels, making decision-making more transparent. The presence of uncertainties, amplified by distribution shifts, is not merely an additional challenge but a crucial aspect of real-world environments’ unpredictability. Employing uncertainty-aware ViTs to detect and improve model generalizability presents a significant research opportunity. Future studies should delve into how uncertainties influence the adaptation and generalization capabilities of ViTs, emphasizing the integration of uncertainty quantification methods. Such investigative efforts are crucial for gaining a thorough understanding of how modern vision networks can exploit uncertainties to enhance the field of domain adaptation and generalization.

This review is the first to comprehensively gather recent work on using ViTs to address distribution shifts in DA and DG approaches. The growing number of publications highlights increasing interest and rapid evolution in the field. We see a promising future for ViTs in addressing distribution shifts and aim to guide future research toward creating more robust and versatile deep learning models.
