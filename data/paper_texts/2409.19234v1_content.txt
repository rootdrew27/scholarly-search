SECTION: Decoding Android Malware with a Fraction of Features: An Attention-Enhanced MLP-SVM Approach
The escalating sophistication of Android malware poses significant challenges to traditional detection methods, necessitating innovative approaches that can efficiently identify and classify threats with high precision. This paper introduces a novel framework that synergistically integrates an attention-enhanced Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) with a Support Vector Machine (SVM) to make Android malware detection and classification more effective. By carefully analyzing a mere 47 features out of over 9,760 available in the comprehensive CCCS-CIC-AndMal-2020 dataset, our MLP-SVM model achieves an impressive accuracy over 99% in identifying malicious applications. The MLP, enhanced with an attention mechanism, focuses on the most discriminative features and further reduces the 47 features to only 14 components using Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA). Despite this significant reduction in dimensionality, the SVM component, equipped with an RBF kernel, excels in mapping these components to a high-dimensional space, facilitating precise classification of malware into their respective families. Rigorous evaluations, encompassing accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score metrics, confirm the superiority of our approach compared to existing state-of-the-art techniques. The proposed framework not only significantly reduces the computational complexity by leveraging a compact feature set but also exhibits resilience against the evolving Android malware landscape.

SECTION: Introduction
The Android operating system, with over 3.9 billion active users as of 2024, has become a predominant target for cybercriminals. Its open-source nature and the ease of distributing apps through third-party stores make it particularly susceptible to malware attacks. Traditional detection methods, primarily based on static analysis of application permissions, are increasingly ineffective against modern malware that employs advanced obfuscation techniques, dynamic code execution, and strategic evasions.

Deep learning has shown great promise in addressing these challenges due to its capability to unravel complex data patterns, significantly enhancing the accuracy of malware detection and classification. However, the precise classification of malware families remains a nuanced and underexplored area. This classification is crucial for identifying attack vectors and devising targeted defenses. Additionally, the rise of adversarial attacks on deep learning models underscores the necessity for robust and resilient detection frameworks.

This paper proposes an innovative framework that integrates an attention-enhanced Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) for robust feature extraction with a Support Vector Machine (SVM) enhanced by a Radial Basis Function (RBF) kernel for precise malware family classification. Our approach leverages the CCCS-CIC-AndMal-2020 dataset, starting with an analysis of just 47 out of over 9,760 features. The attention mechanism within the MLP adaptively weights the significance of various features, enhancing the model’s focus and interpretability. This enables the MLP to effectively perform representation learning, capturing the essential characteristics of the input data. The MLP is trained using these 47 features, and the trained MLP model is subsequently used to reduce the feature set by stripping down 95% of the features, ensuring that only the most informative features are retained. Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA) is then applied to further refine these features to just 14 components, optimizing the feature space for classification. Despite this significant reduction in dimensionality, the SVM component, equipped with an RBF kernel, excels in mapping the 14 LDA-reduced components to a high-dimensional space, facilitating precise classification of malware into their respective families. This approach demonstrates remarkable performance across various metrics, achieving an accuracy of 99% in identifying malicious applications.

The feature reduction strategy plays a crucial role in enhancing computational efficiency and potentially improving the model’s generalizability by mitigating the risk of overfitting. By focusing on the most informative features, the model can process data faster and more effectively, making it a scalable solution for real-world applications.

To ensure the transparency and interpretability of our model, we employ explainable AI (XAI) techniques, specifically SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations), to evaluate feature importance and provide insights into the decision-making process. This not only enhances understanding but also ensures the robustness of our model against adversarial attacks.

Our framework addresses current methodological deficiencies by presenting a scalable, robust, and adversary-aware solution. Rigorous evaluations, including metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score, confirm the superiority of our approach compared to existing state-of-the-art techniques. By significantly reducing computational complexity through a compact feature set, integrating an attention mechanism for enhanced feature focus, employing XAI for model interpretability, and demonstrating adaptability to evolving malware, our research offers a potent solution for efficient Android malware detection and classification, setting a new standard in mobile cybersecurity.

SECTION: Proposed Approach
SECTION: Theoretical Foundations of MLP-SVM Integration with Attention Mechanism
This section elaborates on the theoretical underpinnings and practical implementation of our framework, which synergistically integrates Multi-Layer Perceptrons (MLPs), Support Vector Machines (SVMs) with a Radial Basis Function (RBF) kernel, an Attention mechanism, and Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA). This integration capitalizes on the distinct yet complementary strengths of each component, resulting in a robust and efficient system for Android malware detection and family classification.

MLPs, with their deep feedforward neural network architecture, excel at learning complex, non-linear relationships within data, making them powerful tools for representation learning. Letrepresent a-dimensional input feature vector of an Android application. Our MLP, composed oflayers, transforms this input through a series of non-linear transformations:

wheredenotes the hidden activations at layer,andare the weight matrix and bias vector of layer, respectively,, andis the activation function at layer, typically a Rectified Linear Unit (ReLU).

The output of the final hidden layer,, serves as the learned feature representation of the input application.

To further enhance the discriminative power of these learned features, we introduce an attention mechanism. The attention layer dynamically weighs each feature inbased on its relevance to the classification task. The attention weights, denoted by, are computed as:

whereandare trainable parameters of the attention layer. The final feature representation,, is obtained by applying the attention weights:

wheredenotes element-wise multiplication. Figureillustrates the integration of the attention mechanism within our model architecture.

Following feature extraction by the attention-enhanced MLP, we apply LDA to further refine the feature set. LDA seeks to find a projection matrix,, that maximizes the ratio of between-class scatter to within-class scatter, whereis the desired number of output dimensions. This can be formulated as:

whereandare the between-class and within-class scatter matrices, respectively, anddenotes the trace of a matrix.

The LDA-transformed features,, are obtained by projecting the attention-weighted features onto the LDA subspace:

In our implementation,, resulting in a significant reduction in dimensionality while preserving information crucial for discriminating between malware families.

Finally, the refined features from LDA are used to train an SVM with an RBF kernel for malware family classification. The RBF kernel, defined as:

implicitly maps the LDA features into a higher-dimensional space where linear separation between families is more achievable. The SVM learns a decision function of the form:

whereare the support vectors,their corresponding labels,are the learned weights, andis the bias term.

By maximizing the margin between classes in this transformed feature space, the SVM achieves robust classification performance even in the presence of complex and potentially noisy data.

The addition of an Attention layer aims to further enhance the model’s ability to focus on salient features. The pseudocode for implementing the attention layer is outlined in Algorithm. This mechanism is crucial when dealing with complex data structures found in Android malware.

SECTION: Overall Framework
In this section, we discuss the overarching framework of our system, focusing on how the layers of the MLP are aligned with the attention layer. We will then describe how the model, once trained, is utilized for representation learning before performing classification with an SVM equipped with an RBF kernel.

SECTION: Framework Overview
The MLP model serves as the primary detection mechanism, employing a deep neural network architecture that includes multiple fully-connected layers with Rectified Linear Unit (ReLU) activations. This configuration excels at learning complex interrelations among a diverse array of static and dynamic application features, such as app permissions, API calls, network traffic patterns, and suspicious strings, effectively distinguishing between benign and malicious applications.

The attention layer significantly enhances the MLP’s capability to extract features more efficiently, focusing on the most informative parts of the input data which are critical for accurate classification.

Following the detection phase, LDA is employed to distill the features extracted by the MLP. LDA achieves this by identifying linear combinations of the original features that maximize the ratio of between-class scatter to within-class scatter, effectively separating different malware families while minimizing variance within each family. This step simplifies and reduces the complexity required for SVM training. After applying LDA, the feature set is reduced from 512 to just 14 components. These components are then utilized to train the SVM model, which is equipped with a Radial Basis Function (RBF) kernel. This SVM model performs fine-grained classification of the detected malware into distinct families. The SVM benefits from its ability to project features into a higher-dimensional space, thereby facilitating the creation of non-linear decision boundaries that adeptly separate various malware families based on their unique behavioral patterns.

The process of feature extraction using the attention-enhanced MLP can be viewed as representation learning. By learning to focus on the most salient features of the input data, the MLP effectively creates a robust representation of the application’s behavior. This representation is less sensitive to noise and variations in the input, leading to a more robust and generalizable malware detection system.

SECTION: Synergistic Model Integration
Our framework leverages the strengths of both MLP and SVM models by integrating them into a synergistic pipeline. The MLP, enhanced by the attention mechanism, learns robust feature representations from the raw application data, effectively performing initial malware detection. These representations are then refined by LDA, reducing dimensionality while simultaneously optimizing for class separability. This streamlined feature set is then fed into the SVM, which leverages its ability to construct non-linear decision boundaries for accurate malware family classification. This combination allows our system to benefit from the MLP’s proficiency in feature extraction and the SVM’s ability to handle complex, non-linear relationships between features and malware families.

SECTION: Operational Flow
The operational flow of our framework is systematically organized into four key steps shown in Fig., each integral to the detection and classification of Android malware:

Utilize the CCCS-CIC-AndMal-2020 dataset to extract a comprehensive set of static and dynamic features from Android applications.

Employ the MLP model, enhanced with an attention layer, to analyze the extracted features and accurately differentiate between benign and malicious applications.

Apply the SVM model with an RBF kernel, using the refined features from the MLP model’s penultimate layer, to categorize the detected malware into specific families.

Assess the framework through both traditional performance metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score, and interpretative analysis using SHAP values to validate the model’s efficacy in malware detection and classification.

SECTION: Experimental Setup
SECTION: Dataset
Our study leverages the comprehensive CCCS-CIC-AndMal2020 dataset to facilitate a nuanced analysis of Android malware. This dataset, encompassing 400,000 apps equally distributed between benign and malicious categories, includes 14 malware types across 191 families, making it notable for its diversity and volume. It is instrumental in training and validating our proposed MLP-SVM model. Specifically, the "Dynamic" and "Static" analysis components offer a detailed view of app behaviors and characteristics, enabling precise feature extraction and model optimization. Dynamic analysis reveals runtime malware actions, while static analysis provides insights into the app’s code structure without execution. Our methodology leverages both dynamic features, such as system calls and network traffic, and static features, like permissions and API calls, to craft a robust detection mechanism. This dual approach ensures comprehensive coverage of the Android malware landscape, promising significant advancements in detection accuracy and classification precision.

SECTION: Implementation Details
The dataset employed in this study, derived from the CCCS-CIC-AndMal-2020 collection, includes both static and dynamic features. Static features capture attributes such as application permissions and API calls, while dynamic features represent runtime behaviors, including network traffic and system logs. We extracted features using customized scripts to convert all relevant data points into a format suitable for machine learning models. Non-numeric columns were encoded using LabelEncoder, transforming categorical data into numerical format. The number of unique categories encoded for each non-numeric column varied, ranging from 669 to 77,741. The final combined dataset resulted in a feature space of 9,768 dimensions, with a total of 329,071 samples ready for further analysis and model training.

A significant challenge in the CCCS-CIC-AndMal-2020 dataset is class imbalance, as depicted in Fig.. This skewed distribution can lead to overfitting, where models may bias towards the majority class. To mitigate this and ensure a balanced learning process, we used adjusted class weights during model training. The class weights were computed using thefunction from the scikit-learn library, with the parameterspecified. This approach assigns higher weights to underrepresented classes, increasing their importance during training and improving the model’s ability to generalize and accurately classify instances across all classes.

The raw data underwent a comprehensive feature engineering process to extract meaningful representations. Non-numeric columns were encoded using LabelEncoder, transforming categorical data into numerical format suitable for ML algorithms. Missing values were addressed using median imputation, chosen due to the observed skewed distribution of features, ensuring that missing data did not hinder the training process while minimizing bias. Subsequently, standardization normalized the features, scaling each to have zero mean and unit variance, preventing features with varying scales from disproportionately influencing the models.

Feature selection was performed using the SelectKBest method with the chi2 statistic, chosen for its efficiency in identifying features strongly associated with the target variable. Chi2 is well-suited for the mixed nature of the dataset, containing both categorical and numerical features. The SelectKBest method selected the top 47 features out of 9,768, significantly reducing dimensionality while retaining the most informative features for model training.

The dataset was split into training and test sets, with the training set comprising 263,256 samples and the test set consisting of 65,815 samples. This split allows for reliable evaluation of the model’s performance on unseen data, providing an estimate of its generalization ability. While Recursive Feature Elimination (RFE) could offer a more refined subset of features by considering feature interactions, SelectKBest provided a faster solution, which was crucial given the high dimensionality of the initial feature space. This efficiency expedited the model development process without compromising performance, as demonstrated by the promising results achieved by both MLP and SVM models.

To combat overfitting, our approach encompasses a multi-faceted strategy designed to enhance the robustness and generalizability of our models. Initially, we employed the Optuna framework for feature selection to reduce the complexity of the model and focus on the most informative features. Furthermore, we implemented regularization techniques, specifically l1 and l2 regularization, to prevent our models from learning noise and memorizing the training data, which are essential for mitigating overfitting. Additionally, we used ensembling methods, particularly the RandomForestClassifier, known for its variance-reducing bagging properties, to further protect against overfitting.

Figurebelow provides a visual representation of the effectiveness of these strategies. It illustrates the F1 scores before and after class weights were applied, revealing that the baseline model, despite achieving higher F1 scores, was likely overfitting to more frequently occurring classes. The adjusted model, with class weights, shows a moderated performance, indicative of a more balanced and generalized approach. This graphical evidence supports our comprehensive measures taken to defend against overfitting, demonstrating our commitment to developing robust predictive models.

The MLP model employed in this study was specifically designed to tackle the complexities associated with Android malware detection. Utilizing the hyperparameter optimization framework, Optuna, we conducted a systematic exploration to ascertain the most effective configurations of neural network layers, activation functions, and regularization methods.

The optimized architecture of the MLP model includes:

This layer processes the optimized feature vector derived from extensive preprocessing of both static and dynamic data attributes.

Comprises two densely connected hidden layers utilizing ReLU activation functions, pivotal for capturing the non-linear dynamics within the data.

Integrated subsequent to the hidden layers, this mechanism adaptively weights the significance of various features, thereby augmenting the model’s focus and interpretability. It is mathematically defined as:

whereandrepresent the trainable parameters.

Implements a softmax activation function to output a probabilistic distribution over 14 malware families plus one benign category.

To ensure accuracy and robustness in the training process, the Cosine Annealing with Warm Restarts learning rate scheduler was adopted:

This method periodically resets the learning rate, effectively exploring the parameter space and helping to escape local minima.

In addition, strategies such as early stopping and trial pruning were implemented to optimize training and mitigate overfitting. Early stopping ceases training when there is no improvement in validation loss for a set number of epochs, while trial pruning discontinues less promising trials early based on intermediate outcomes to enhance computational efficiency.

The training was conducted over 20 trials with 30 epochs each, utilizing a rigorous 10-fold stratified cross-validation to maintain representativeness in each fold, ensuring consistency and reliability of performance across diverse data segments. The inner and outer folds further validated the model’s generalizability on unseen data.

The parameters refined during the Optuna trials are documented in Table. These parameters were fine-tuned to ensure optimal model performance:

Following the optimization, the final model training was based on the best parameters identified, focusing on maximizing accuracy and preventing overfitting. This methodical approach ensures that the MLP model is not only customized to the specific requirements of the dataset but is also capable of effective generalization to new, unseen Android malware threats.

As shown in Figure, the parallel coordinate plot provides a comprehensive view of the optimization process. It highlights how different parameter combinations, from activation functions to learning rates, affect the model’s performance. Notably, variations in batch size and activation functions show significant impacts on the objective value, emphasizing their critical role in the model’s effectiveness.

Following the feature extraction process performed by a pre-trained MLP model, we employed LDA to reduce the dimensionality of the extracted features. LDA, a supervised dimensionality reduction technique, effectively projects the features onto a lower-dimensional space while maximizing class separability. This resulted in a reduction from 512 features to 14 LDA components, offering a streamlined yet discriminative feature space for subsequent classification.

We then utilized a Support Vector Machine (SVM) model for malware classification, exploring various kernel options to identify the most suitable configuration for our dataset. Hyperparameter optimization was conducted using the Optuna framework, which leverages efficient search algorithms like tree-structured Parzen estimators to explore the hyperparameter space effectively. The key hyperparameters we optimized included:

We tested both ‘linear’ and ‘RBF’ kernels to determine the optimal approach for capturing the relationships within our feature space.

This parameter was varied fromtoon a logarithmic scale to control the trade-off between model complexity and training error.

For the RBF kernel, we explored ‘scale’ and ‘auto’ options to adjust the influence range of individual support vectors.

To ensure robust evaluation and mitigate overfitting, we incorporated a 10-fold stratified cross-validation strategy within the hyperparameter optimization process. This allowed us to assess the generalization ability of different hyperparameter combinations across various data subsets and reflect the model’s performance on unseen data. Our analysis revealed that the RBF kernel consistently provided high validation accuracy, often achieving optimal performance with higher C values, which suggests that a more complex decision boundary is beneficial for capturing the intricacies of the data. Finally, using the optimally tuned parameters identified by Optuna, we trained the final SVM model on the entire training dataset. This approach, combining LDA for feature reduction and Optuna for hyperparameter optimization, yielded a highly accurate and efficient SVM model for Android malware classification.

The comparison of MLP and SVM models reveals that the SVM model, despite using a significantly reduced feature set, outperforms the MLP in various metrics. This demonstrates the efficiency of using the SVM model for classification once the MLP has performed initial feature extraction and reduction. By leveraging the trained and saved MLP model, future malware detection tasks can save time and computational resources by directly utilizing the SVM for classification. The SVM’s superior performance, despite using only 14 features, highlights the effectiveness of this hybrid approach in malware detection and family classification.

Moreover, the models exhibit stability and strong generalization ability, as evidenced by the consistent performance across train, validation, and test sets over multiple trials. The low gap between training and validation/test performance suggests the models are robust to overfitting, further emphasizing their reliability in real-world malware detection scenarios. This robustness is crucial for practical deployments, where models must handle diverse and evolving threats without degradation in performance.

SECTION: Feature Importance Evaluation
Understanding the model’s decision-making process is crucial for interpreting its predictions and assessing its reliability. To achieve this, we analyze the importance of features extracted from the CCCS-CIC-AndMal-2020 dataset, which includes both static and dynamic analysis features from a diverse set of Android malware and benign applications.

Figurepresents the top 20 most significant features based on their contribution to the model’s performance. The visualization includes features from various categories, including memory usage, network activity, API calls, and file interactions. The prominence of memory-related features like,, andsuggests that the model relies heavily on the memory footprint and allocation patterns of applications to distinguish between malicious and benign behavior. Similarly, network features such asandhighlight the importance of network communication patterns in identifying malware.

The presence of API call features likeandindicates that the model considers the usage of specific APIs, potentially related to process manipulation and native code execution, as indicative of malicious activity. Furthermore, the inclusion of static analysis features like application hashes demonstrates the model’s ability to leverage unique identifiers and signatures for classification.

The log-scaled significance scores provide a clear visualization of the relative importance of features with varying magnitudes. This allows us to observe the full spectrum of feature contributions without obscuring the impact of features with smaller scores.

Additionally, this analysis informs the development of more targeted data preprocessing and feature engineering strategies. By understanding which features are most influential, we can optimize our data collection and processing pipelines to focus on the most relevant information, potentially reducing computational overhead and improving model efficiency. This targeted approach also helps in fine-tuning the model to be more sensitive to subtle variations in malware behavior, enhancing its ability to detect zero-day threats and advanced persistent threats (APTs) that often exhibit novel or minimally invasive behaviors.

SECTION: Feature Importance Evaluation from trained SVM model Using SHAP Values
The use of SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations) values facilitates a deep understanding of the decision-making process within our SVM classification model. By quantifying the contribution of each feature to the prediction, SHAP values provide a powerful method for feature importance evaluation, ensuring model transparency and interpretability.

The beeswarm plot (Figure) illustrates the distribution and impact of each feature on the model’s predictions with color coding indicating the feature value: red for higher and blue for lower values. This plot provides insights into which features are most influential and how their values affect the prediction outcomes. The waterfall plot (Figure) details the cumulative impact of the most influential features for a specific instance, demonstrating how each feature’s contribution leads from the base value to the final prediction.

Both plots underscore the significant and nuanced roles of individual features, allowing for a detailed understanding that supports robust and transparent machine learning modeling.

By reducing the feature space from 9,760 to 14 components using an attention-enhanced MLP and LDA, our approach significantly decreases computational and memory overhead while maintaining classification accuracy.
However, the framework’s scalability must be evaluated with larger, more complex datasets. For extensive, high-dimensional data, techniques like Incremental Principal Component Analysis (IPCA) or Distributed LDA could be employed to maintain performance. To enhance scalability for real-time, large-scale malware detection, integrating distributed computing paradigms such as MapReduce or Apache Spark would enable horizontal scaling, mitigating latency and ensuring high throughput.

For deployment in resource-constrained environments like mobile or edge devices, model compression techniques such as knowledge distillation and network quantization should be explored. These optimizations would reduce the model’s computational footprint without compromising detection efficacy, ensuring versatility across both high-performance cloud-based systems and low-resource devices. This approach would maintain operational efficiency and scalability while adapting to diverse deployment scenarios in the Android ecosystem.
