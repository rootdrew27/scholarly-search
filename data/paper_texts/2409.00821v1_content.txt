SECTION: Real-Time Weather Image Classification with SVM: A Feature-Based Approach
Accurate classification of weather conditions in images is essential for enhancing the performance of object detection and classification models under varying weather conditions. This paper presents a comprehensive study on classifying weather conditions in images into four categories: rainy, low light, haze, and clear. The motivation for this work stems from the need to improve the reliability and efficiency of automated systems, such as autonomous vehicles and surveillance, which must operate under diverse weather conditions. Misclassification of weather conditions can lead to significant performance degradation in these systems, making robust weather classification crucial.

Utilizing the Support Vector Machine (SVM) algorithm, our approach leverages a robust set of features, including brightness, saturation, noise level, blur metric, edge strength, motion blur, Local Binary Patterns (LBP) mean and variance for radii 1, 2, and 3, edges mean and variance, and color histogram mean and variance for blue, green, and red channels. Our SVM-based method achieved a notable accuracy of 92.8%, surpassing typical benchmarks in the literature, which range from 80% to 90% for classical machine learning methods. While deep learning methods can achieve up to 94% accuracy, our approach offers a competitive advantage in terms of computational efficiency and real-time classification capabilities. Detailed analysis of each feature’s contribution highlights the effectiveness of texture, color, and edge-related features in capturing the unique characteristics of different weather conditions. This research advances the state-of-the-art in weather image classification and provides insights into the critical features necessary for accurate weather condition differentiation, underscoring the potential of SVMs in practical applications where accuracy is paramount.

Accurate weather classification in images is essential for enhancing object detection in adverse weather conditions, significantly improving the performance and reliability of automated systems such as surveillance and autonomous vehicles. Traditional machine learning approaches, including SVM, have been widely employed due to their robustness and effectiveness in handling classification tasks. In this study, we introduce a novel SVM-based weather classification algorithm designed to categorize images into four distinct weather conditions: rainy, low light, haze, and clear. Our approach leverages a comprehensive set of 20 features, including Local Binary Patterns (LBP)mean and variance, edge strength and variance, noise level and color histogram mean and variance for blue, green, and red channels, among others, specifically chosen to capture the unique visual characteristics associated with each weather condition. Through extensive experimentation, our SVM classifier demonstrated superior performance in terms of accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score compared to existing techniques. Although deep learning methods may offer higher accuracy, our SVM-based approach is more efficient and computationally less intensive, making it suitable for real-time applications. By focusing on feature engineering and the robustness of SVM, our methodology provides a reliable and efficient solution for weather classification in images, contributing to the advancement of automated weather detection systems.

The classification of weather conditions in images is a well-researched area with significant advancements in recent years. Traditional machine learning approaches, including SVMs, have been a popular choice due to their robustness and effectiveness in handling classification tasks. Simultaneously, deep learning techniques, particularly Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), have gained considerable traction for their ability to learn complex representations of data, which can significantly enhance the accuracy of weather classification tasks. Traditional SVM-based methods for weather classification often rely on features such as sky, cloud, rain streaks, snowflakes, and dark channels extracted from segmented images. These methods typically involve extracting these weather-specific properties and using SVM to classify the weather conditions. Earlier works have utilized such features to achieve reasonable classification accuracy. However, these methods face challenges in distinguishing between similar weather conditions due to limited feature sets. Deep learning techniques, particularly CNNs, have gained popularity for weather classification tasks in recent years. CNNs excel in learning complex representations of data, which can significantly enhance the accuracy of weather classification. Studies such as ”Weather Image Classification using Convolutional Neural Network with Transfer Learning”have demonstrated substantial improvements over traditional methods by leveraging large-scale datasets and transfer learning strategies. However, deep learning models often require substantial computational resources and large datasets for training, making them less feasible for applications with limited resources. Some studies have explored hybrid approaches that combine traditional machine learning algorithms with deep learning techniques. These methods aim to leverage the strengths of both approaches to achieve better performance. For example, using pre-trained CNNs for feature extraction followed by SVM for classification has shown promising results. Despite these advancements, hybrid methods still face challenges in achieving real-time performance and handling diverse weather conditions effectively. Our research builds upon the strengths of traditional SVM approaches while addressing their limitations by introducing a novel set of features specifically designed for weather classification. We utilize a comprehensive feature set that includes 20 different features, with a focus on Local Binary Patterns (LBP) mean and variance, edge strength, noise level and color moments. These features capture critical aspects of weather conditions, such as texture complexity, edge clarity, and noise characteristics, providing a robust foundation for classification. The introduction of novel features such as motion blur and color variance further differentiates our work from existing studies, offering new perspectives on weather classification. In summary, our research addresses the gaps in existing weather classification methods by combining the robustness of SVM with an innovative feature set. This approach not only improves classification accuracy but also ensures computational efficiency, making it suitable for real-time applications in diverse weather conditions, paving the way for further advancements in this field.

The SVM weather classifier in this study aims to effectively categorize images into four weather conditions: rainy, low light, haze, and clear. This classifier uses 20 distinct features that capture various aspects of the images to improve classification accuracy. The features include brightness, saturation, noise level, blur metric, edge strength, motion blur, Local Binary Patterns (LBP) mean and variance for radii 1, 2, and 3, edges mean and variance, and color histogram mean and variance for blue, green, and red channels. Our feature set was selected based on their relevance to weather conditions. For instance, the Edge Strength X and Noise Level are indicative of image quality affected by weather, while color variations and brightness can reflect different lighting conditions. These features were computed from the images and used to train the SVM classifier. SVM is a well-known supervised learning model, functions by finding the optimal hyperplane that separates the data into different classes. The process begins with mapping the input features into a higher-dimensional space, where it becomes easier to separate the classes linearly. The SVM algorithm then identifies the hyperplane that maximizes the margin between the classes. In our approach, the SVM is trained on a dataset with labeled weather conditions, allowing it to learn the relationships between the features and the corresponding weather categories. After training, the SVM model can predict the weather condition of new, unseen images by evaluating the feature values and determining the side of the hyperplane on which the data point lies. This methodology ensures a robust classification performance by leveraging a comprehensive set of features that capture the essential characteristics of different weather conditions, thus enabling effective weather classification in images.

We conducted experiments using a SVM classifier to classify weather conditions in images. The dataset comprised of images with clear, rainy, low light, and hazy weather conditions. Clear weather images were sourced from the PASCAL VOC 2007, containing 4000 images. To generate synthetic weather conditions:

withsampled uniformly from 1.5 to 5.

: Rainy images were created by adding random raindrops and applying a motion blur to the images.

For real-world data, we used the RESIDE dataset for haze, ExDarkfor low light, and a combination of the Weather Phenomenon Database (WEAPD)and the RID dataset for rain. These datasets provided over 4000 images for clear conditions, 3000 for haze, 1200 for low light, and 100 for rain.

Feature extraction was a critical component of our approach, focusing on a diverse set of features to capture the distinctive characteristics of each weather condition. The features extracted included:

Our SVM model achieved an accuracy of 93.75%, with a precision of 94.25%, recall of 94%, and F1-score of 94.5%. These results demonstrate the effectiveness of our feature set and the robustness of the SVM classifier in distinguishing different weather conditions.

Our SVM model demonstrated robust performance across both synthetic and real datasets. For the synthetic dataset, the model achieved an average accuracy of 97%, with a precision of 97%, recall of 97%, and F1-score of 97%. The performance was consistently high across all weather conditions, achieving perfect scores (100%) for haze and rain, and near-perfect scores for low light and clear conditions.

For the real dataset, the model achieved an average accuracy of 92.8%, with a precision of 93%, recall of 93%, and F1-score of 93%. The performance varied slightly across different weather conditions, with the highest accuracy (98%) observed for low light and the lowest (88%) for rain.

In comparison to other models, our SVM model outperformed traditional machine learning approaches, achieving higher accuracy than the cited studies which reported accuracies ranging from 80.4% to 94%. While some deep learning models achieved comparable or slightly higher accuracy, our SVM model offers a more computationally efficient solution.

Feature importance analysis revealed that color variance and mean for the red, green, and blue channels were the most significant contributors to classification performance. For the synthetic datasets, the top features were color variance and mean for the red channel, followed by green and blue channel statistics.

For the real datasets, the feature importance ranking was similar, with color features dominating the top positions, indicating the strong influence of color information on the classification accuracy.

In summary, our SVM-based approach offers a balanced trade-off between performance and computational efficiency, demonstrating high accuracy in classifying weather conditions and providing a viable alternative to more resource-intensive deep learning models.
