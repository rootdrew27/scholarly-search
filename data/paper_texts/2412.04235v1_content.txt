SECTION: Article Title

The abstract serves both as a general introduction to the topic and as a brief, non-technical summary of the main results and their implications. Authors are advised to check the author instructions for the journal they are submitting to for word limits and if structural elements like subheadings, citations, or equations are permitted.

SECTION: 1Introduction

The Introduction section, of referenced text[bib1]expands on the background of the work (some overlap with the Abstract is acceptable). The introduction should not include subheadings.

Springer Nature does not impose a strict layout as standard however authors are advised to check the individual requirements for the journal they are planning to submit to as there may be journal-level preferences. When preparing your text please also be aware that some stylistic choices are not supported in full text XML (publication version), including coloured font. These will not be replicated in the typeset article if it is accepted.

SECTION: 4Equations

Equations inLaTeXcan either be inline or on-a-line by itself (“display equations”). For
inline equations use the$...$commands. E.g.: The equationis written via the command$H \psi = E \psi$.

For display equations (with auto generated equation numbers)
one can use the equation or align environments:

where,

Notice the use of\nonumberin the align environment at the end
of each line, except the last, so as not to produce equation numbers on
lines where no equation numbers are required. The\label{}command
should only be used at the last line of an align environment where\nonumberis not used.

The class file also supports the use of\mathbb{},\mathscr{}and\mathcal{}commands. As such\mathbb{R},\mathscr{R}and\mathcal{R}produces,andrespectively (refer Subsubsection3.1.1).

SECTION: 5Tables

Tables can be inserted via the normal table and tabular environment. To put
footnotes inside tables you should use\footnotetext[]{...}tag.
The footnote appears just below the table itself (refer Tables1and2).
For the corresponding footnotemark use\footnotemark[...]

The input format for the above table is as follows:

In case of double column layout, tables which do not fit in single column width should be set to full text width. For this, you need to use\begin{table*}...\end{table*}instead of\begin{table}...\end{table}environment. Lengthy tables which do not fit in textwidth should be set as rotated table. For this, you need to use\begin{sidewaystable}...\end{sidewaystable}instead of\begin{table*}...\end{table*}environment. This environment puts tables rotated to single column width. For tables rotated to double column width, use\begin{sidewaystable*}...\end{sidewaystable*}.

SECTION: 6Figures

As per theLaTeXstandards you need to use eps images forLaTeXcompilation andpdf/jpg/pngimages forPDFLaTeXcompilation. This is one of the major difference betweenLaTeXandPDFLaTeX. Each image should be from a single input .eps/vector image file. Avoid using subfigures. The command for inserting images forLaTeXandPDFLaTeXcan be generalized. The package used to insert images inLaTeX/PDFLaTeXis the graphicx package. Figures can be inserted via the normal figure environment as shown in the below example:

In case of double column layout, the above format puts figure captions/images to single column width. To get spanned images, we need to provide\begin{figure*}...\end{figure*}.

For sample purpose, we have included the width of images in the optional argument of\includegraphicstag. Please ignore this.

SECTION: 7Algorithms, Program codes and Listings

Packagesalgorithm,algorithmicxandalgpseudocodeare used for setting algorithms inLaTeXusing the format:

You may refer above listed package documentations for more details before settingalgorithmenvironment. For program codes, the “verbatim” package is required and the command to be used is\begin{verbatim}...\end{verbatim}.

Similarly, forlistings, use thelistingspackage.\begin{lstlisting}...\end{lstlisting}is used to set environments similar toverbatimenvironment. Refer to thelstlistingpackage documentation for more details.

SECTION: 8Cross referencing

Environments such as figure, table, equation and align can have a label
declared via the\label{#label}command. For figures and table
environments use the\label{}command inside or just
below the\caption{}command. You can then use the\ref{#label}command to cross-reference them. As an example, consider
the label declared for FigureLABEL:fig1which is\label{fig1}. To cross-reference it, use the commandFigure \ref{fig1}, for which it comes up as
“FigureLABEL:fig1”.

To reference line numbers in an algorithm, consider the label declared for the line number 2 of Algorithm1is\label{algln2}. To cross-reference it, use the command\ref{algln2}for which it comes up as line4of Algorithm1.

SECTION: 8.1Details on reference citations

StandardLaTeXpermits only numerical citations. To support both numerical and author-year citations this template usesnatbibLaTeXpackage. For style guidance please refer to the template user manual.

Here is an example for\cite{...}:[bib1]. Another example for\citep{...}:[bib2]. For author-year citation mode,\cite{...}prints Jones et al. (1990) and\citep{...}prints (Jones et al., 1990).

All cited bib entries are printed at the end of this article:[bib3],[bib4],[bib5],[bib6],[bib7],[bib8],[bib9],[bib10],[bib11],[bib12]and[bib13].

SECTION: 9Examples for theorem like environments

For theorem like environments, we requireamsthmpackage. There are three types of predefined theorem styles exists—thmstyleone,thmstyletwoandthmstylethree

For mathematics journals, theorem styles can be included as shown in the following examples:

Example theorem text. Example theorem text. Example theorem text. Example theorem text. Example theorem text.
