SECTION: Model-independent Gamma-Ray Bursts Constraints on Cosmological Models Using Machine Learning

In this paper, we calibrate the luminosity relation of gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) with the machine learning (ML) algorithms
from the Pantheon+ sample of type Ia supernovae in a cosmology-independent way. By using K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) and Random Forest (RF) selected with the best performance in the ML algorithms, we calibrate the Amati relation (-) relation with the A219 sample to construct the Hubble diagram of GRBs.
Via the Markov Chain Monte Carlo numerical method with GRBs at high redshift and latest observational Hubble data, we find the results of constraints on cosmological models by using KNN and RF algorithms are consistent with those obtained from GRBs calibrated by using the Gaussian Process.

SECTION: 1Introduction

Type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia) have been often used as a standard candle with the maximum redshift observed at[139,140]. Therefore, observations of luminous objects at higher redshift than SNe Ia are required to explore the cosmic evolution at the high-redshift region.
Gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) are the most intense bursts of high-energy gamma rays in a short time at high redshifts (the maximum redshift of GRB can reach at[30]). Utilizing the GRB’s luminosity relations, which are connections between measurable properties of the instantaneous emission and the luminosity or energy[58,127,69,174,102,60,32,151],
GRBs have been used as cosmic probe
to study the evolutionary history of our universe and the properties of dark energy[137,45,70,59,170,103,154,71,138].

In the early studies of GRB cosmology[45,138], the luminosity relations of GRBs had usually been calibrated by assuming a certain cosmological model. Thus, the so-called circularity problem is encountered[71].
In order to avoid this circularity problem,[97]proposed a cosmological model-independent method to calibrate GRBs at low redshift interpolated from SNe Ia and built the GRB Hubble diagram at high redshift. Following the interpolation method used in[97],
many works have constrained cosmological models with GRBs without any cosmological assumption, see, i. e.[22,23,165,166,99,100,157,108].
On the other hand, the simultaneous method[6,155]in which the parameters of the relationship and the cosmological model fitting simultaneously has been proposed to avoid the circularity problem.
Recently, it is found that the GRB relation parameters are almost identical in all cosmological models, which seems to indicate that GRBs can be standardized within error bars[85].
It should be notice that GRB luminosity relations can be calibrated by using other observations. For example,[4]proposed to calibrate GRB correlations by using the observational Hubble data (OHD) obtained with the cosmic chronometers (CC) method fitted by the Bézier parametric, and built up a Hubble diagram consisting of 193 GRBs with the Amati relation (the-correlation)[5].111Besides the calibration method by using SN Ia and OHD, the mock data of gravitational waves (GWs)[158], quasar sample[46]and the angular diameter distances of galaxy clusters[74]have also been used to calibrate GRBs.Following this method,
several works have constrained cosmological models with the Amati relation calibrated by OHD[116,112,113,123].222For recent GRB luminosity relations and the applications in cosmology, see e.g.[78,38,39,41,171,172,173,76,159,107,96], and[145,85,86,110,50,18,19,108,101,42,43,44,95,90,124,10,51],
and[131,21,163]. For reviews, see[111,121].

The reconstruction from cosmological data in the calibration of GRBs can be constructed in several ways.
Similar to the interpolation method used in[97]and the Bézier parametric used in[4], GRBs are calibrated from the local data by using the polynomial fitting[87,152], an iterative procedure[98], the local regression[26,48], the cosmography methods[24,68], a two-steps method minimizing the use of SNe Ia[78,122], and the Padé approximation method[109].
Recently, the non-parametric method has been addressed to reconstruction of the dark
energy, which can effectively reduce the errors of reconstructed results compared to the approaches mentioned in the above.[130]studied the evolution of the cosmological
equation of state in a nonparametric way with high redshift GRBs.

Gaussian Process (GP) is a powerful nonlinear interpolating tool without the need of specific models or parameters, which is a fully Bayesian approach that describes a distribution over functions with a generalization of Gaussian distributions to function space[142]. GP approach has been used in various cosmological studies, see, e.g.[142,143,144,12,92]. However, in GP analysis, it is typically assumed that the errors in observational data follow a Gaussian distribution[142], which may pose a substantial limitation when reconstructing functions from data.[167]found that GP exhibit sensitivity to the fiducial Hubble constantand the results are significantly impacted by.[182]proposed that GP should be used with caution for the reconstruction of OHD and SNe Ia.
Furthermore, the results can be affected by the choose of the kernel functions, and there are a lot of kernel functions available that we can choose. Machine Learning (ML) algorithms are a set of technologies that learn to make predictions and decisions by training with a large amount of the observational data, which are a collection of processing units designed to identify underlying relationships in input data; therefore, when an appropriate network is chosen, the model created using ML can accurately depict the distribution of the input data in a completely data-driven way.
The ML methods have shown outstanding performance in solving cosmological problems in both accuracy and efficiency to provide powerful tools and methods for cosmological research[62,63,8,161,162,172,54,112,16].
Genetic Algorithms (GA) has been used to investigate the redshift evolution of the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) temperature[8], the distance duality relations (DDR) with gravitational wave (GW)[75,9],
and the late-time cosmological tensions using redshift-space distortion data in the low-redshift background to show that phantom dark energy is more preferable than the cosmological constant[67].[161]proposed a new nonparametric approach for reconstructing a function from observational data using an Artificial Neural Network (ANN).[54]used the Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN) and the Bayesian Neural Networks (BNN) methods to reduce the computation load of expensive codes for dark energy models; these methods have subsequently been used to calibrate the GRB relations[55,149,150].

Recently,[112]explored three machine learning treatments (linear regression, neural network, and random forest) based on Bézier polynomials to alleviate the circularity problem with the Amati relation.
The main issue in the calibration of GRBs is that we do not know a priorithe the correct curve to fitting data.
The overall advantage on using machine learning has been discussed in[112]:
i) Healing degeneracy and over-fitting issues.
Multiple models can fit the same data will lead to degeneracy in fitting data approaches, and the overall approach of ML overcomes those issues due to interpolation, polynomials with generic over-fitting treatments.
ii) Speeding up the process of data adaption.
ML can maintain the consistency of data, which automatically encapsulates data without postulation over the shapes and orders.
The complexity of ML models turns out to intimately related to the number of data points.
Therefore, the overall process of calibration can be improved.[16]deployed ML algorithms to measure thethrough regression analysis as Extra-Trees, ANN, Gradient Boosting, and Support Vector Machines (SVM), and found that the SVM exhibits the best performance in terms of bias-variance tradeoff in most cases, showing itself a competitive cross-check to GP.

More recently,[86]compiled a total 220 GRBs (the A220 sample) to derive the correlation and cosmological model parameter constraints simultaneously.
By using the GP method,[101]calibrated the Amati relation with the A219 GRB sample333Removed GRB051109A, which are counted twice in the A220 sample[86].from the Pantheon sample[139]which contains 1048 SNe, and constrained cosmological models in flat space with GRBs at high redshift and OHD via the Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) numerical method.[95]calibrated GRBs from the latest OHD to construct the GRB Hubble diagram and constrained Dark Energy models with GRBs at high redshift and SNe Ia in a flat space.[124]used the Pantheon+ sample[140], which contains 1701 SNe light curves of 1550 spectroscopically confirmed SNe Ia, for calibrating the Amati relation to reconstruct cosmography parameters.[169]used the Pantheon+ sample to calibrate the Amati relation from the latest 221 GRB sample[79].

In this work, we calibrate the Amati relation with the A219 GRB data[101]at low redshift from the Pantheon+ SNe Ia sample[140]using the ML algorithms.
Combining the high redshift GRB data with the latest OHD, we constrain cosmological models in a flat space with MCMC numerical method. We also compare the results of ML and GP methods.

SECTION: 2Reconstructing the apparent magnitude redshift Relation from Pantheon+

In this section, we use ML algorithms to fit SNe Ia data set to reconstruct the apparent magnitude-redshift () relation. To implement the regression models of ML algorithms, we use scikit-learn444https://scikit-learn.org/stable/index.html, which offers a variety of ML classification and regression models to choose, e.g.,
Linear Regression(LR), Lasso Regression(Lasso), Random Forest (RF), Support Vector Regression (SVR), and K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN). In order to estimate the performance of different ML algorithms that reduce the residuals between real and fitting data,
we use the values of
the mean squared error (MSE),
which are given by

We also select MSE as the evaluation index and utilize the hyperparameter optimization method (GridSearchCV555https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.model_selection.GridSearchCV.html)
provided by scikit-learn to determine optimal hyperparameters for the ML algorithms.666In grid search, we assess various hyperparameter combinations for each ML algorithms and utilize the 5-fold cross-validation method to select the one that minimizes MSE as the final configuration

The Pantheon+ dataset consists of 1701 light curves of 1550 unique spectroscopically confirmed SNe Ia (= 0.00122 to 2.26137), with a table of size 1701x47 (Pantheon+SH0ES.dat777https://github.com/PantheonPlusSH0ES/DataRelease/tree/main/Pantheon%2B_Data/4_DISTANCES_AND_COVAR).
It also consists of a 1701x1701 covariance matrixwhich represents the covariance between SN Ia due to systematic and statistical uncertainties. Although ML algorithms in scikit-learn are able to predict apparent magnitude of SN Ia at a given redshift, they do not provide their uncertainties. Following[16], we first develop a Monte Carlo-bootstrap (MC-bootstrap) method to generate 1000 instances of data () with the initial candidate sample being drawn from the distribution of Pantheon+’s apparent magnitude () and covariance matrix.
Based on Monte Carlo sampling datasets, 1000 iterations of ML algorithms training are conducted to predict each redshift of the testing set by the objective functions. The average of the prediction results of the objective functions is taken to obtain thevalue, and the standard deviation is taken to obtain the errorvalue.
The data flow diagram of ML in our study is shown in Fig.1.

It should be noted that the Pantheon+ sample do not use SNe from SNLS atdue to sensitivity to theband in model training, therefore the Pantheon+ statistics betweenare lower than that of Pantheon[139]and the Joint Light-curve Analysis (JLA,[11]). We selected a series of different redshift splits (from 0.6 to 2.26, taking a point every 0.2) in the training phase of each ML algorithms to determine the reliable redshift splits of the Pantheon+ sample to calibrate GRBs.
For each redshift split, we take the SNe Iato calculate MSE, and the results with the ML algorithms are shown in Fig.2.
The results with the ML algorithms at critical redshifts (e.g.) are listed in Tab.1.
From Fig.2, Tab.1(the subgraph of Fig.2), we find that KNN and RF methods show the relatively better performances in redshift splits from 0.6 to 2.26; and all ML methods except SVM achieve the best values at, which are consistent with the redshift point empirically chosen in[124]and[169]from Pantheon+ sample.
In Fig.3, we plot the reconstruction of the apparent magnitude from Pantheon+ by KNN and RF methods with the relatively better performances reconstructed using the optimal hyperparameters888When training machine learning algorithms based on each of 1000 Monte Carlo sampled datasets, we employ the GridSearchCV method to determine the optimal hyperparameter values..

SECTION: 3Calibration of the Amati relation and the GRB Hubble diagram

For GRB data set, we use the A219 sample[101]with one point GRB051109A removed in the A220 sample[86], which includes the A118 data set with the smallest intrinsic dispersion, as well as 102 data set (A102) from 193 GRBs analyzed by[4]and[48]. We divide A219 sample into two subsamples, i.e., the low-redshift GRB sample (), which consists of 37 GRBs, and the high-redshift sample (), which consists of 182 GRBs.
The Amati relation which connects the spectral peak energy () and the isotropic equivalent radiated energy () is expressed as

where,andare free coefficients;andcan be respectively expressed as:

whereis the observational value of GRB spectral peak energy andis observational value of bolometric fluence. The luminosity distance () is related the distance modulus (),.
In order to express the GRB relation direct from the apparent magnitude, we introduce a new coefficientto rewrite the Amati relation by

where,andare free coefficients needing to be calibrated from the GRBs observed data in the formula. Therefore, we can calibrate the Amati relation without assuming any prior values of.

We use likelihood function methods[133]to fit the parameters of Amati relation
which can be written as[104,95]

Here, the intrinsic scatter, in whichandare the intrinsic scatter along the-axis and-axis.
The likelihood function proposed by[133]has the advantage of not requiring the arbitrary choice of an independent variable fromand[7,95].999The use of the[31]likelihood (here,is the intrinsic scatter of GRBs,, and.) may introduce a subjective bias on the choice of the independent variable in the analysis. The Bivariate Correlated Errors and intrinsic Scatter (BCES) method[3]used in recent Fermi data[164]take into account the possible intrinsic scatter of the data.

The python packageemcee[64]is used to implement the MCMC numerical fitting.
The best fitting parameters,,by KNN and RF methods
from the A219 sample at redshiftare shown in Fig.4and Tab.2For comparison, we also use theGaPPpackage101010https://github.com/astrobengaly/GaPPof the well-known Gaussian process with the squared exponential covariance function[142].
From Tab.2,
We find that the results of GP are consistent with previous analyses that obtained in[124]using GaPP from SNe Ia at; and the fitting results by GP are consistent with that by KNN and RF methods in 1uncertainty, which indicate that ML methods are competitive to GP method.

In order to derive the luminosity distances of GRBs at high-redshift to build the GRB Hubble diagram, we assume that the calibration results of the Amati relation at low-redshift are valid at high-redshift.111111It should be noted that whether the luminosity relations of GRB are redshift dependent or not is still under debate.
The possible evolutionary effects in GRB relations have been discussed in many works[104,160,48,50,46,149].[86]found that the Amati relation is independent of redshift within the error bars.[107,108]proposed the improved Amati relation by accounting for evolutionary effects via copula, and found that a redshift evolutionary correlation is slightly favored.[79]found no statistically significant evidence for the redshift evolution with the Amati relation from the analysis of data in different redshift intervals with the 221 GRB sample.[90]calibrated the Amati relation into five redshift bins and find that GRBs seem to evolve with redshift.
Further examinations of possible evolutionary effects should be required for considering GRBs as standard candles for a cosmological probe.We utilize the calibration results obtained through the likelihood[133]to construct the GRB Hubble diagrams atfor avoiding any bias in the selection of independent variables.
The Hubble diagram (the apparent magnitude verse the redshift) of A219 GRB sample by KNN and RF is plotted in Fig.5.
The uncertainty of the apparent magnitude with the Amati relation can be expressed as

where

Here, and the inverse of covariance matrix from the fitting coefficients is.

SECTION: 4Constraints on cosmological models

We use the GRB data in the Hubble diagram at high-redshift to constrain cosmological models.
The cosmological parameters can be fitted by minimizing thestatistic.
Thefunction for the GRB data can be expressed as

We consider three the dark energy (DE) models for a flat space121212The cosmological models have been usually constrained with flat spatial curvature. It should be noted that recently works constrain nonspatially flat models with GRBs and results are promising[86,18,113]., theCDM model with the Equation of State (EoS), theCDM model (), and the CPL model evolving with redshift with a parametrization EoS (). In a flat space,

hereis the speed of light,, and, which is determined by,

The OHD can be obtained from the galactic age differential method[82], which have advantages to constrain cosmological parameters and distinguish dark energy models.
In our analysis, we also use the latest OHD[95]to constrain cosmological models,
including the 31 Hubble parameter measurements at[148,117,118,119,180,132], and a new point atproposed by[81]in a similar approach. In this work, we also use the 31 OHD atand one point atfrom[81].131313It should be noted that[17]obtained another new OHD at. Considering these two measurements are not fully independent and their covariance is not clear, we only use the point[81], which takes advantage of thefraction of systematic uncertainty. One could either use the data from[17]alternatively with other 31 OHD to investigate cosmology[20,123,57,90].The total OHD contain 32 data, including 15 correlated measurements[117,118,119]with the covariance matrix[120]. Thefunction for the OHD is,

Here the difference vector for the 15 correlated measurements between the observed data () and the theoretical values () is:;is the inverse of the covariance matrix; and thefunction for the 17 uncorrelated measurements is

.

The totalwith the joint data of GRB+OHD can be expressed asThe python packageemcee[64]for the MCMC numerical fitting is used to constrain DE models from the GRB. The cosmological parameters can be fitted by using the minimizationmethod through MCMC method. The joint results from 182 GRBs (A219)with 32 OHD are shown in Fig. 6 (CDM), Fig. 7 (CDM) and Fig. 8 (CPL).

We find the joint results by the KNN method are most identical with results by the RF algorithm with 182 GRBs atin the A219 sample and 32 OHD. By the KNN method, we obtained=,=for the flatCDM model;=,=,=for the flatCDM model; and=,=,=,=for the CPL model at the 1confidence level, which favor a possible DE evolution ().
For comparison, we also use the calibration results ofGaPPto constrain cosmological models, which are consistent with
the results by KNN and RF with slight difference.
We also find that the results by GP from the Pantheon+ data atare consistent with previous analyses that obtained in[101]using GP from the Pantheon data atfor theCDM model and theCDM model.

For the well-knowntension[77],with a redshift evolving is an interesting idea141414See e. g.Wong et al. [168],Krishnan et al. [88],Krishnan et al. [89],Dainotti et al. [40]for earlier work..[80]found thatvalue is consistent with that measured from the local data at low redshift and drops to the value measured from the CMB at high redshift.
Moreover,[115]found the evolving (,) values abovein Pantheon+ sample.
Compared to the fitting results from CMB data based on theCDM model at very high-redshift (= 67.36 km,= 0.315)[128]and SNe Ia at very low-redshift (= 74.3 km,= 0.298)[140], we find that thevalue with GRBs by ML atand OHD atseems to favor the one from the Planck observations, and thevalue of our results for the flatCDM model is consistent with the CMB observations at the 1confidence level.

In order to compare the different cosmological models and ML algorithms, we compute the values of the Akaike information criterion (AIC;[1,2]) and the Bayesian information criterion (BIC;[141]), respectively:,;
whereis the maximum value of the likelihood function,is the number of free parameters in a model, andis the number of data.
We find that the results ofandby KNN, RF and GP methods indicate that theCDM model is favoured respect to theCDM model and the CPL model, which are consistent with the previous analyses[4]obtained from the 193 GRBs by using the OHD atthrough the Bézier parametric curve combined with 740 SNe Ia.

SECTION: 5Results of the Dainotti relation

GRB relations of the prompt emission phase involving the X-ray afterglow plateau phase exist less variability in its features[32,26]. In this section, we also investigate the Dainotti relation151515[32,33,34,35,36]proposed the relation between the plateau luminosity and the end time of the plateau in X-ray afterglows (2D Dainotti relation) to constrain for cosmological parameters.
Furthermore,[37]proposed the 3D Dainotti relation among the rest-frame time and X-ray luminosity at the end of the plateau emission and the peak prompt luminosity with small intrinsic scatter.[18,19]investigated the 2D and 3D Dainotti relation standardized with the Platinum sample[39]including 50 GRB data.by the ML algorithms for comparison.

The Platinum sample[39]listed in Table A1 of[18]are used to calibrate the Dainotti relation by the KNN and RF methods. The 2D Dainotti relation which connects the X-ray luminosityand the rest-frame time at the end of the plateau emissionis expressed as[18]

whereandare free coefficients,can be calculated by

whereis the measured gamma-ray energy flux at,is the X-ray spectral index of the plateau phase in the X-ray band[56];is related with the reconstructed apparent magnitude by using the ML algorithms and the absolute magnitude161616Following[125,126], we fix the absolute magnitude..
We use sub-sample atfrom the Platinum sample, which consists of 50 GRBs () to calibrate the 2D Dainotti relation.
The results by KNN and RF algorithms are summarized in Table 4. We find that the calibration results by ML from[31]likelihood function are consistent with those in the current works calibrated with sub-sample atof the Platinum sample from SNe Ia by neural networks[126]:; and from OHD by a Gaussian Processes Bayesian reconstruction tool[61]:.

We combine GRB data at high-redshift () with the calibrated 2D Dainotti relation by[133]likelihood function to constrain cosmological parameters. The joint results from the high-redshift GRBs and OHD are summarized in Table 5. We find that the results are consistent with analyses that obtained in the calibration with the Amati relation by[133]likelihood function in Tab. 3.

SECTION: 6Conclusions

In this paper, we use the ML algorithms to calibrate the Amati relation from the Pantheon+ sample to obtain the GRB Hubble diagram with the A219 sample. The KNN and RF algorithms are selected to calibrate Amati relations due to the best performances.
By the KNN algorithm with GRBs atin the A219 sample and 32 OHD, we obtained=,=for the flatCDM model;=,=,=for the flatCDM model; and=,=,=,=for the CPL model at the 1confidence level, which are most identical with results by the RF algorithm. These results favor a possible DE evolution () at the 1-confidence region for both cases.
We also find that theCDM model is favoured respect to theCDM model and the CPL model from the results ofand.
Our results with GRBs atare consistent with previous analyses that obtained in[101,108,95]using GP from the Pantheon data and OHD at. Compared ML to GP, we find that KNN and RF methods with the lowest values in terms of MSE are competitive technics to GP in precision.

Furthermore, we also investigate the Dainotti relation by the ML algorithms for comparison. We find that calibration results of the 2D Dainotti relation are consistent with those in the current works[126,61]; and constrain results at the high-redshift from the Dainotti relation are consistent with that obtained from the Amati relation.

It should be noted that recent observations from the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument
(DESI) collaboration display slight deviations fromCDM model, see e.g.,[27,114,29].
In future, GRBs could be used to set tighter constraints on cosmological models by the ML technics from recent Fermi data[164]with much smaller scatters, as well as the data from the Chinese-French mission SVOM (the Space-based multiband astronomical Variable Objects Monitor)[15], which will provide a substantial enhancement of the number of GRBs with measured redshift and spectral parameters.
