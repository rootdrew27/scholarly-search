SECTION: 1Introduction

Please follow the steps outlined in this document very carefully when
submitting your manuscript to Eurographics.

You may as well use theLaTeXsource as a template to typeset your own
paper. In this case we encourage you to also read theLaTeXcomments
embedded in the document.

SECTION: 2Instructions

Please read the following carefully.

SECTION: 2.1Language

All manuscripts must be in English.

SECTION: 2.2Margins and page numbering

All printed material, including text, illustrations, and charts,
must be kept within a print area 7 inches (17.7 cm) wide by
9.44 inches (24 cm) high. Do not write or print anything
outside the print area. Number your pages on odd sites right
above, on even sites left above, no page number on the first site.
Page numbers should be local to each paper in the formatwiththe current page number andthe total number of pages of the respective paper.

SECTION: 2.3Formatting your paper

All text with the exception of the abstract must be in a two-column format.
The total allowable width of the text area – including header and footer
lines – is 177 mm (7 inch) wide by 245 mm (9.64 inch) high.

Columns are to be 84 mm (3.3 inch) wide, with a 8 mm (0.315 inch) space
between them.

The space between the header line and the first line of the text body and
between the last line of the text body and the footer line is 5 mm
(0.196 inch) each.

SECTION: 2.4Type-style and fonts

Wherever Times is specified, Times Roman may also be used. If
neither is available on your word processor, please use the font
closest in appearance to Times that you have access to. Only
Type-1 fonts will be accepted.

MAIN TITLE. The title should be in Times 17-point, boldface type and
centered. Capitalize the first letter of nouns, pronouns, verbs, adjectives,
and adverbs; do not capitalize articles, coordinate conjunctions, or
prepositions (unless the title begins with such a word). Leave two blank
lines after the title.

AUTHOR NAME(s) and AFFILIATION(s) are to be centered beneath the title and
printed in Times 9-point, non-boldface type. This information is to be
followed by two blank lines.

The ABSTRACT ist to be in a one-column format. The MAIN TEXT is to be in a
two-column format.

MAIN TEXT. Type main text in 9-point Times, single-spaced. Donotuse
double-spacing. All paragraphs should be indented 1 em (the length of the
dash in the actual font). Make sure your text is fully justified – that is,
flush left and flush right. Please do not place any additional blank lines
between paragraphs. Figure and table captions should be 9-point Times
boldface type as in Figure2.

Long captions should be set as in Figure1or
Figure3.

Figures which need the full textwidth can be typeset as Figure3.

Callouts should be 9-point Times, non-boldface type. Initially
capitalize only the first word of section titles and first-, second-, and
third-order headings.

FIRST-ORDER HEADINGS. (For example,1. Introduction) should be Times
9-point boldface, initially capitalized, flush left, with one blank line
before, and one blank line after.

SECOND-ORDER HEADINGS. (For example,2.1. Language) should be Times
9-point boldface, initially capitalized, flush left, with one blank line
before, and one after. If you require a third-order heading (we discourage
it), use 9-point Times, boldface, initially capitalized, flush left, preceded
by one blank line, followed by a period and your text on the same line.

The headline(authors / title)must be shortened if it uses the full
two column width of the main text.
There must be enough space for the page numbers. Please use “et al.” if
there are more than three authors and specify a shortened version for your title.

SECTION: 2.5Footnotes

Please donotuse footnotes at all!

SECTION: 2.6References

List all bibliographical references in 9-point Times, single-spaced, at the
end of your paper in alphabetical order. When referenced in the text, enclose
the citation index in square brackets, for example[Lous90]. Where
appropriate, include the name(s) of editors of referenced books.

For your references please use the following algorithm:

oneauthor: first 3 chars plus year –
e.g.[Lous90]

two,threeorfourauthors: first char
of each family name plus year – e.g.[Fellner-Helmberg93]or[Kobbelt97-USHDR]or[Lafortune97-NARF]

more than 4authors: first char of family name from
first 3 authors followed by a ’*’ followed by the year –
e.g.[Buhmann:1998:DCQ]or[FolDamFeiHug.etal93]

For BibTeX users a style fileeg-alpha.bstandeg-alpha-doi.bstis available which uses the above algorithm.

For Biber users a style fileEG.bbxis available which uses the above algorithm.

SECTION: 2.7Illustrations, graphs, and photographs

All graphics should be centered.

For all figures please keep in mind that youmust notuse images with transparent background!

If your paper includes images, it is very important that they are of
sufficient resolution to be faithfully reproduced.

To determine the optimum size (width and height) of an image, measure
the image’s size as it appears in your document (in millimeters), and
then multiply those two values by 12. The resulting values are the
optimumandresolution, in pixels, of the image. Image quality
will suffer if these guidelines are not followed.

Example 1:
An image measures 50 mm by 75 mm when placed in a document. This
image should have a resolution of no less than 600 pixels by 900
pixels in order to be reproduced faithfully.

Example 2:
Capturing a screenshot of your entirepixel display
monitor may be useful in illustrating a concept from your research. In
order to be reproduced faithfully, thatimage should
be no larger than 85 mm by 64 mm (approximately) when placed in your
document.

SECTION: 2.8Color

Please observe:as of 2003 publications in the proceedings of the
Eurographics Conference can use color images throughout the paper. No
separate color tables are necessary.

However, workshop proceedings might have different agreements!
Figure3is an example for creating color plates.

SECTION: 2.9Embedding of Hyperlinks / Typesetting of URLs

Due to the use of the packagehyperrefthe original behavior
of the commandurlfrom the packageurlis not available. To circumvent this problem we either recommend to
use the commandhttpAddrfrom the
included packageegweblnk(see below) or to replace the
commandurlby the commandwebLink– e.g. in cases whereurlhas been used
widely in BibTeX-References. In the latter case we suggest to run
BibTeX as usual and then replace all occurences ofurlbywebLink

The provided commands for hyperlinks, in a nutshell, are:

e.g.http://diglib.eg.org/handle/10.2312/306

e.g.https://diglib.eg.org/handle/10.2312/306

e.g.ftp://www.eg.org/EG/DL/ftpupload

e.g.http://diglib.eg.org/handle/10.2312/306

e.g.publishing@eg.org

e.g.publishing@eg.org

e.g.http://www.eg.org/some_arbitrary_long/but_useless/URL

SECTION: 2.10PDF Generation

Your final paper should be delivered as a PDF document with all typefaces
embedded.LaTeXusers should usedvipsandps2pdfto
create this PDF document. Adobe Acrobat Distiller may be used in place ofps2pdf.

Adobe PDFWriter isnotacceptable for use. Documents created with
PDFWriter will be returned to the author for revision.pdftexandpdflatex(and its variants) can be used only if the author can
make certain that all typefaces are embedded and images are not downsampled
or subsampled during the PDF creation process.

Users with no access to these PDF creation tools should make available a
PostScript file and we will make a PDF document from it.

The PDF filemust notbe change protected.

dvipsshould be invoked with the-Ppdfand-G0flags in order to use Type 1 PostScript typefaces:

If you are using version 7.x of GhostScript, please use the following method of invokingps2pdf, in
order to embed all typefaces and ensure that images are not downsampled or subsampled in the PDF
creation process:

If you are using version 8.x of GhostScript, please use this method in place of the example above:

Configuration of these tools to embed all typefaces can be accomplished by editing theupdmap.cfgfile
to enable inclusion of the standard (or base) 14 typefaces.

Linux users can run theupdmapscript to do this:

Windows users should edit theupdmap.cfgfiles found in their TeX installation directories (one or both
of the following may be present):

Ensure the value forpdftexDownloadBase14is "true," and then follow the instructions found here:http://docs.miktex.org/manual/to update your MikTeX installation.

We recommend to use a Distiller job options file that embeds
all typefaces and does not downsample or subsample images when creating the PDF document.

SECTION: 2.11License Form

You must include your signed Eurographics License Form
when you submit your finished paper. We MUST have this form before
your paper can be published in the proceedings.

There is a separate workflow for signing licenses for Computer Graphics Forum
(regular issues, conference issue, special issues).

SECTION: 2.12Conclusions

Please direct any questions to the production editor in charge of
these proceedings.
