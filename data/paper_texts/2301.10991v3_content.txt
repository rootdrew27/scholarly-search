In a recent joint work with Frank Garvan, we investigated the transformation of the elements of the-dissection of, whereis a primitive-th root of unity, under special congruence subgroups of, leading us to interesting symmetry observations. In this work, we derive analogous transformation results for the two-variable crank generating functionin terms of generalized eta products. We consider the action of the groupon the elements of the-dissection of, leading us to new symmetries for the crank function. As an application, we give a new proof of the crank theorem predicted by Dyson in 1944 and resolved by Andrews and Garvan in 1988. Furthermore, we present identities expressing the elements of the crank dissection in terms of generalized eta products for primesand.

SECTION: 1.Introduction

The rank function is an important statistic in the theory of partitions. It is defined as the largest part minus the number of parts in a partition. In 1944, Dyson gave this definition of the rank statistic and conjectured that it decomposes the partitions ofandinto five and seven equinumerous classes respectively, a conjecture that was proven 10 years later by Atkin and Swinnerton-Dyer. He also prophesied the existence of a “crank” statistic for a similar explanation of the modcongruence of Ramanujan viz.

and it wasn’t until 1988 that the elusive crank was found by Andrews and Garvan[1]. The crank of a partition is defined as the largest part if there are no ones in the partition and otherwise the number of parts larger than the number of ones minus the number of ones. It is worth mentioning here that after the discovery of the partition crank, Garvan, Kim and Stanton[13]came up with new statistics on partitions (also called cranks) which combinatorially prove Ramanujan’s congruences for the partition function modulo,,and, giving explicit bijections between equinumerous crank classes. However, the crank statistic that we work on in this paper is the ordinary partition crank defined by Andrews and Garvan which we simply refer to as the crank. Letdenote the number of partitions ofwith crank congruent tomod. Then they show that

thus providing an almost combinatorial explanation of all three partition congruences of Ramanujan. Let, where. Letdenote the number of partitions ofwith crank. Then the two variable generating function for the crank function, due to Andrews and Garvan (see[1]) is given by

Equivalently we define

In this paper, we look at the transformation and symmetry of this function, whenis a primitive-th root of unity. We find that the crank function satisfies the same type of symmetries as the rank generating function, which was our subject of interest in[14].Throughout this paper we use the standard-notation:

We also define a class of generalized eta products and functions that we will use frequently in expressions for our crank identities and to study their transformations in the subsequent sections.

the two-variable generating function for the Dyson rank function so that

The modularity of the rank generating function, whereis replaced by a primitive-th root of unity for a general primewas first studied by Bringmann and Ono[7]. Building on the groundbreaking work of Zwegers[22]and[23]around the turn of the century, who realised how Ramanujan’s mock theta functions occur naturally as the holomorphic parts of certain real analytic modular forms, Bringmann and Ono showed thatis the holomorphic part a weak Maass form of weighton, where the non-holomorphic part is a Mordell integral of a theta function. Garvan[12], in 2019, observed that the introduction of a simple multiplier and a generalized correction series factor reduces the modularity of the rank function to larger and more natural congruence subgroups of.In a subsequent joint work with Garvan[14], we generalized and improved these results of his paper[12]on transformations for Dyson’s rank function leading us to exciting observations of symmetry among the elements of dissection of the rank generating function. In this paper, we try to implement our ideas in[14]and those of Garvan[12]to obtain analogous results for the crank generating function.Since its discovery, it has been well established that the crank statistic plays a central role in the theory of partitions. Perhaps the most important breakthrough came in 2005 when Mahlburg showed that the crank itself satisfies Ramanujan-type congruences using Hecke’s theory of modular forms. In his seminal paper, Mahlburg establishes congruences for infinitely many non-nested arithmetic progressions modulo powers of primes by tying the crank generating function to the Dedekind eta function and Klein forms. Rewriting his functions in the framework of generalized eta products, we have the following result.

Letbe prime, suppose, and define

where, following Yang[21], we consider the generalized eta product

Thenis a weakly holomorphic modular form of weight 1 on the congruence subgroup.

Mahlburg further goes on to establish a rescaled form of the crank generating function as the sum of a weakly holomorphic function onand a modular form onof integral weights ([17], Section 4). We show that after multiplying with an appropriate eta product and a power of, we can deduce the modularity of the crank generating function to a simpler congruence subgroup of, resembling the result for the rank generating function[12, Theorem 1.2].

Letbe prime. Then the function

is a weakly holomorphic modular form of weighton the group, where.

This result is analogous to the modularity of the rank generating function that was studied in[12]. There the author also considered the modularity and transformation of elements of the-dissection of the rank generating function. We note that in the definition for these rank dissection elements, there are two cases pertaining to whetheris a quadratic residue or non-residue modulo[14, Definition 1.4]. In case of the crank generating function, we have the following analogous expression for elements of the dissection and subsequent modularity results. These dissection elements do not feature the correction factor involving the seriesas in the definition of the rank dissection elementswhere the seriesappears in the case whenis a quadratic residue modulo[14, Definition 1.4 (ii)].

Using our main symmetry result in Theorem1.6above and the conditions for modularity of the generalized eta functions[14, Theorem 3.1], we can determine the transformation ofand find that the exact same symmetry result holds for this crank counterpart of theelement. We do not pursue this here, but the interested reader could investigate further (see[14], Theorem 5.1 for details).The paper is organized as follows. In Section2we build up the framework of our results and introduce a class of eta functions arising in the definition of our completed crank function and determine their transformation under special congruence subgroups of. In Section3, we prove our main results on the modularity, transformation and symmetry of the crank function. Section4is devoted to calculating lower bounds for the orders ofat the cusps ofwhich we utilize to prove identities in the subsequent section. Finally, in Section5, we give a new proof of the crank theorem and also state identities forwhenandin terms of generalized eta-functions, proving two such identities modusing the Valence formula, the modularity conditions and the orders at cusps determined in the previous section.

Let. The generating function of the crank due to Andrews and Garvan is given by

Replacingbyin the above expression and multiplying both sides by, we can express the crank generating function in terms of our eta functions as

This leads to our first main result stated in the introduction section. We restate it here.

We end this section with an illustration of the validity and advantage of our theorem. The following are the elements of the-dissection offorin terms of generalized eta-functions. A similar form of this identity can also be found in the works of Garvan[11]and Hirschhorn[15].

We can thus conclude that in the light of our symmetry theorem, the identities forin terms of generalized eta functions can be fully determined if we know one identity each for the cases when,is a quadratic residue modandis a quadratic non-residue mod.

SECTION: 5.Crank theorem and crank modidentities

SECTION: 5.1.Dyson’s rank conjectures and the crank theorem

10 years after they were proposed by Dyson[10], Atkin and Swinnerton Dyer[4]came up with a proof of the Dyson’s rank conjectures stated below.

For all nonnegative integers,

Garvan, in[12]notes that the proof in[4]involved finding and proving identities for basic hypergeometric functions, theta-functions and Lerch-type series using the theory of elliptic functions. It also involved identifying the generating functions for rank differencesfor,for eachand each,,…. Subsequently in his paper[12, Section 6.3], Garvan gives a new proof of these conjectures using the theory of modular forms, by calculating the orders of the rank dissection elementat the cusps offorandand making use of the Valence formula. In this section, we employ Garvan’s idea in[12]to give a new proof of the crank theorem modulo(Equation (1.3)) using the Valence formula and the orders ofat the cusps ofcalculated in the previous section. It is easy to observe that in our setup, the crank theorem is equivalent to showing

For,is defined in terms of the invariant order, which is interpreted in the usual sense. See[20, p.91]for details of this and the notation used.

In the following table, we give the order ofat the cusps using Theorem4.5. Here.

An easy calculation by hand shows that. Expandingwe see that this implies the coefficient ofisand thus we have that. HenceBut. The Valence Formula implies thatis identically zero which proves the crank theorem.

The same method could be applied to prove the modandand cases of the crank theorem i.e. Equations (1.1) and (1.2).

SECTION: 5.2.Crank modidentities

In this section, we give identities forwhenandin terms of generalized eta-functions given in Definition1.1. Crank modidentities were first studied by Bilgici in[6]similar to the work on rank modidentities by Atkin and Hussain[3]and rank modidentities considered by O’Brien in his thesis[19]. In[14], we also gave such identities for elements of the the rank generating function. In general, these identities are of the form

whereare eta-quotients comprising of generalized eta-functions, andare cyclotomic coefficients. From Theorem3.3, we know thatis a weakly holomorphic modular form of weighton. The proof of the identities primarily involve establishing the equality using the Valence formula and showing that the RHS is also a weakly holomorphic modular form of weighton.In[14], we derived conditions for an eta-quotientto be a weakly holomorphic modular form of weighton.

Letandbe as in Definition1.1.

In Section 7 of[14], we developed an algorithm for proving rank modidentities that utilizes the Valence Formula. Here, we follow the steps of the algorithm to prove crank identities modulo.For the casesand, we simply give the form of the identities omitting the values of the coefficients, for each of the casesand whenis a quadratic residue and a non-residue modulo. Their proofs follow the same technique using the algorithm as it does for.To help calculate the order of the generalized eta functions at the cusps, we also need the following result from[14, Prop.7.4].

We follow the steps of the algorithm in the process of proving the above identity.

We check the conditions for modularity as in Theorem5.3forandinvolved in (5.8). We first make note of two aspects of our functions. First, from Apostol’s[2, Theorem 4.9, p.87], we observe that the eta quotientis modular under the congruence subgroup. Also, writing the theta quotientin its equivalent vector notationin accordance with our Definition1.1, we observe that it doesn’t contribute to the weight and

Thus it suffices to check the first step for the functions, which was achieved in Step 1 of the proof for the previous identity.

Next, we calculate the orders of the generalized eta-functions atand considering the identity with zero coefficients removed, we find that. Thus we divide each generalized eta-function by, which has the lowest order at.

Utilizing the same algorithm, the proof follows similar to the identity for the quadratic residue casedone previously. We omit the details here.Below, we present one identity for each of the quadratic residue, quadratic non-residue andcases forand. These are new and do not seem to appear in the literature elsewhere. We however make note of the fact that the same set of theta functionsand vectorsare involved in the corresponding identity for the rank ([14], Subsections 7.3 and 7.4). However, there are much fewer functions in the corresponding identity for the crank here. We do not include the cyclotomic coefficients here, but the exact identities alongwith the maple code can be found here :https://github.com/rishabh-sarma/crank-identities-modulo-13-17-19. Several of these coefficients are zero.

SECTION: 6.Concluding remarks

Building on our work on symmetries of the rank generating function[14], we have found analogous results for the crank generating function in this paper. The transformation and modularity properties as well as the-dissection identities are similar for the rank and crank functions. It would be interesting to examine the underlying theory behind this resemblance more closely. Two other natural problems to consider are finding crank dissection identities for higher primesand also exploring such symmetries for other partition statistics and also their overpartition analogues.
