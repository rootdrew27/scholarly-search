SECTION: Static and Dynamic Analysis
Early malware detection methods primarily relied on static and signature-based approaches.explored the extraction of static features, including byte sequences andexplored the opcode patterns, in conjunction with machine learning techniques for classification. Dynamic analysis methods aimed to understand malware behavior by monitoring network activities and system calls.introduced a malware classification approach based on Hidden Markov Models (HMMs), analyzing API call sequences. However, dynamic analysis proved inefficient, particularly when malware adapted its behavior during execution.

SECTION: Vision-Based Approaches
The transition to vision-based approaches marked a significant advancement in malware detection.began visualizing features like opcode sequences and system calls as images, offering new perspectives on classification.developed an efficient approach to visualising binary files as greyscale images and classfied the images using K-nearest neighbours.demonstrated the effectiveness of visual methods in classifying binary files and analyzing new file structures.

In their follow-up study,introduced a malware detection system achieving an impressive 99.8% accuracy on malware detection. These methods talk only about malware detection, that is, a binary classification into beningn and malign classes, but fail to work in detecting the type of malware, which is also very crucial for system security.

SECTION: Transformer-Based Model
Recent years have witnessed the rise of transformer-based models in malware detection.,introduced BERT(Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers)-based models,presented Malceiver, a hierarchical Perceiver model andintroduced hierarchical transformer architectures for malware classification. The application of transformer-based models was expanded beyond assembly code analysis by Sherlock() a transformer-based model for Android malware classification. Most of these methods rely on analysing and integrating opcodes, which significantly increases the inference time for detection and classification.

SECTION: Methodology
SECTION: Image Representation of Malware
Our approach involves transforming PE binary files into RGB images by reading groups of 3 bytes and arranging them in a 2-dimensional vector space. Each byte, ranging from 0 to 255, is visualized as a pixel value in an image. The three bytes constitute one pixel in each of the three channels (RGB). This method preserves location information between malicious attack patterns and captures the order of these patterns, which is essential for precise classification, especially when dealing with structurally similar malware instances.

SECTION: LeViT-MC Architecture
We propose a novel architecture, LeViT-MC, that combines the strengths of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and Vision Transformers (ViT) to create a robust malware classification system. The architecture consists of two main components:
Binary Classification Stage: A fine-tuned DenseNet CNN followed by a classification head categorizes input images into benign and malign.
Malware Family Classification Stage: For images classified as malign, a LeViT (Lightweight Vision Transformer) further classifies them into specific malware families.

We utilize a fine-tuned DenseNet CNN for the initial binary classification of images into benign and malign categories. DenseNet has demonstrated excellent performance in binary classification tasks for malware images as also showed by. The dense connectivity pattern in DenseNet allows for better feature reuse and improved information flow, making it particularly effective for capturing the intricate patterns present in malware images.

For the more granular task of classifying malign images into specific malware families, we employ the LeViT architecture introduced by. LeViT is designed for faster inference in image classification tasks, making it particularly suitable for real-time malware detection scenarios. More details about the LeViT architecture are given in

SECTION: Transfer Learning and Fine-tuning
To leverage the power of pre-trained models and adapt them to our specific task, we employ transfer learning techniques:
We initialize the DenseNet component with weights pre-trained on ImageNet.
The LeViT component is initialized with weights from a model pre-trained on a large-scale image classification task.
We fine-tune both components on the MaleVis() dataset, allowing the model to adapt to the specific characteristics of malware images.
This approach enables our model to benefit from the general feature extraction capabilities learned from large datasets while specializing in the nuances of malware classification.

SECTION: Dataset and Implementation Details
We utilized the MaleVis() dataset, comprising 14,226 RGB images in 224x224 pixel resolution. The dataset is divided into 26 categories: one representing benign samples and 25 representing various malware types. We have included some samples and more information about the dataset in. We employed the default partition of 70% training and 30% validation data.
Experiments were conducted using an NVIDIA A100-SXM4 GPU with 80GB RAM. Training was performed with a batch size of 32, using the Adam optimizer with an initial learning rate of 1e-5 and a ReduceLROnPlateau scheduler with a decay of 0.1 and patience of 10.

SECTION: Results
LeViT-MC demonstrated superior performance in both accuracy and inference speed. We achieved 96.6% accuracy, a groundbreaking multiclass classification accuracy on the MaleVis dataset, outperforming all the previous state-of-the-art models. A comparision with previous multiclass state-of-the-art classification accuraries is given in

While gaining the highest accuracy, our novel architecture also gains the highest inference speed by utilising the fast inference of LeViT transformers. An inference speed comparision with the average inference speed for different architectures on the same dataset as quoted in the study byis shown in. Our model is about has around 10x better inference times than normal vision transformers and around 3x better inference times than the best CNNs like ResNet.

SECTION: Limitations
While LeViT-MC has demonstrated exceptional performance, a couple of considerations remain:

Our current evaluation was performed on the MaleVis dataset, and while this dataset covers a broad spectrum of malware types, its generalizability to other datasets remains untested.

The computational efficiency observed in controlled environments (e.g., with high-performance GPUs) may not fully translate to resource-constrained devices like IoT systems or embedded malware detection platforms.

SECTION: Conclusion
LeViT-MC demonstrates exceptional performance in malware classification, achieving 96.6% accuracy and processing 2370 images per second. These results underscore the potential of combining CNNs and lightweight Vision Transformers in addressing the challenges of rapid and accurate malware detection and classification.

Looking ahead, our future work will emphasize the practical deployment of our methodology in real-world scenarios. Effective implementation in cybersecurity infrastructures is essential to proactively defend against evolving malware threats. We aim to explore integration with existing security systems, ensuring that our approach not only meets performance benchmarks but also adapts to the dynamic nature of cyber threats. Additionally, we will focus on enhancing explainability in our model to foster trust and transparency in its decision-making processes, facilitating its acceptance in operational environments.

The LeViT-256 architecture, part of the LeViT family, represents a hybrid approach that combines the strengths of convolutional networks and transformer models for image classification tasks. This architecture addresses the computational inefficiencies of standard transformers by integrating convolutional stages to enhance spatial inductive biases, resulting in improved performance and reduced complexity.

LeViT-256 employs a multi-stage structure consisting of:

The architecture processes images through hierarchical down-sampling within its transformer layers, reducing the overall number of operations while maintaining strong performance on image classification benchmarks.

By leveraging multi-scale feature extraction and maintaining smaller feature map sizes, LeViT-256 significantly reduces computational overhead. The model transforms images into patches, processes them through stages of attention layers that capture global contextual features while reducing image resolution, and finally classifies the output using a linear head.
