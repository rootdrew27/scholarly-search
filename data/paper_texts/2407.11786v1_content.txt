However, predicting stock prices accurately is difficult because financial markets are complex and constantly changing. This is especially true for the cryptocurrency market, which is known for its extreme volatility, making it challenging for traders and investors to make wise and profitable decisions. This study introduces a machine learning approach to predict cryptocurrency prices. Specifically, we make use of important technical indicators such as Exponential Moving Average (EMA) and Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) to train and feed the XGBoost regressor model. We demonstrate our approach through an analysis focusing on the closing prices of Bitcoin cryptocurrency. We evaluate the model’s performance through various simulations, showing promising results that suggest its usefulness in aiding/guiding cryptocurrency traders and investors in dynamic market conditions.

SECTION: IIntroduction

Over the past few years, the rapid expansion of the stock market has made it an appealing option for investors seeking high returns and easy access. However, investing in stocks carries inherent risks, underscoring the need for a well-defined investment strategy. Traditionally, investors relied on empirical methods such as technical analysis, guided by financial expertise. With the widespread adoption of financial technology (FinTech), statistical models incorporating machine learning techniques have emerged for forecasting stock price movements. This shift has demonstrated significant success across various markets, including the S&P 500, NASDAQ[1], and the cryptocurrency market[2,3]. In this research, our emphasis is on the cryptocurrency market, a dynamic force in finance, with a particular focus on Bitcoin price prediction[4].

Furthermore, Blockchain technology, the backbone of cryptocurrencies, has gained substantial attention in the banking and financial industry due to its secure and transparent decentralized database[5]. Despite the advantages of abundant market data and continuous trading, the cryptocurrency market faces challenges such as high price volatility and relatively smaller capitalization. Success in cryptocurrency financial trading hinges on the careful analysis and selection of data, making the development of machine learning models crucial for extracting meaningful insights. Models such as Long Short Term Memory (LSTM) and Random Forest (RF) are instrumental in predicting cryptocurrency prices by leveraging historical data and patterns, thereby aiding effective decision-making in this volatile market. Despite the potential, there have been limited studies attempting to create successful trading strategies in the cryptocurrency market.

With the advent of FinTech, machine learning models have been increasingly adopted to forecast stock price movements, transforming the landscape of financial analysis and trading. These models leverage large datasets and complex algorithms to identify patterns and predict future price trends, which has led to notable success across various markets, including the S&P 500 and NASDAQ[1]. In the cryptocurrency market, which is characterized by its high volatility and rapid price fluctuations, machine learning techniques have proven particularly valuable. Studies have demonstrated the efficacy of deep learning methods, such as Stacked Denoising Autoencoders (SDAE) and LSTM networks, in predicting Bitcoin prices with high accuracy[2,3]. These models utilize a variety of inputs, including historical price data, trading volume, public sentiment, and macroeconomic indicators, to generate predictions that can guide investment decisions. The integration of machine learning into FinTech has thus provided investors with powerful tools to navigate the complexities of financial markets, enhancing their ability to make informed and strategic trading decisions.

Despite the advantages of the cryptocurrency market, such as abundant market data and continuous trading, it faces significant challenges like high price volatility and relatively smaller capitalization. Successful trading in this market depends on careful data analysis and selection, making the development of machine learning models crucial for extracting meaningful insights. Models like LSTM and RF are instrumental in predicting cryptocurrency prices by utilizing historical data and patterns, thus aiding effective decision-making in this volatile landscape. While there have been limited studies on developing successful trading strategies in the cryptocurrency market, our research aims to bridge this gap by introducing a novel machine learning strategy using the XGBoost regressor model, which incorporates essential technical indicators and historical data to enhance financial trading strategies.

This research introduces an efficient machine learning approach for forecasting cryptocurrency prices, specifically focusing on Bitcoin. The motivation behind this study stems from the inherent volatility and complexity of the cryptocurrency market, which pose significant challenges for traders and investors. Traditional methods of technical analysis and empirical strategies are often insufficient in predicting price movements in such a dynamic environment. To address this, we propose using the XGBoost regressor model, a powerful machine learning technique known for its robustness and accuracy. Our methodology integrates a comprehensive set of technical indicators, including the Exponential Moving Average (EMA), Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD), Relative Strength Index (RSI), and other relevant metrics derived from historical market data. The data is sourced from Binance via its API, covering a detailed time span with high-frequency intervals, which allows for capturing rapid market changes.

The proposed model undergoes extensive preprocessing and feature engineering to enhance its predictive capabilities. By employing regularization techniques, we mitigate the risk of overfitting and fine-tune the model parameters through a grid search for optimal performance. Our results demonstrate that the XGBoost regressor model significantly improves prediction accuracy, evidenced by low Mean Absolute Error (MAE) and Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) values, as well as a near-perfect R-squared value. This study contributes to the state-of-the-art by providing a robust and scalable solution for cryptocurrency price prediction, leveraging advanced machine learning techniques to navigate the complexities of financial markets and aiding in informed decision-making for traders and investors.

SECTION: IIRelated Work

The effort to forecast cryptocurrency prices has garnered significant interest in recent years, leading to the development of various methods to address this complex problem[6]. This section reviews advanced studies that employ machine learning for predicting cryptocurrency prices, with a particular focus on Bitcoin due to its dominant position and the extensive availability of data.

Among these advancements, machine learning has significantly impacted cryptocurrency price forecasting by providing models that adeptly navigate the complex and volatile digital currency market[7]. These methods range from simple regression models to advanced deep learning networks, each capable of detecting patterns and predicting future prices based on historical data[8].

Cryptocurrency value fluctuations are influenced by numerous factors, which has prompted the adoption of machine learning for price prediction[9,10]. For instance, studies by Greaves and AU[11]have investigated using network attributes and machine learning to predict Bitcoin prices. Similarly, Jang and Lee[12]combined blockchain-related features, time series analysis, and Bayesian neural networks (BNNs) for Bitcoin price analysis.

Building on this foundation, further research by[13],[14], and[15]has applied machine learning to Bitcoin price forecasting. Saad et al.[15]not only predicted prices but also identified critical network attributes and user behaviors influencing price variations in Bitcoin and Ethereum[16], alongside the supply and demand dynamics of cryptocurrencies. Additionally, Sin and Wang[17]utilized neural networks for price predictions, leveraging blockchain data features.

Continuing this trend, Christoforou et al.[18]developed a Bitcoin price prediction model using neural networks, focusing on factors affecting price volatility and utilizing blockchain data and network activity metrics for forecasting. Furthermore, Chen et al.[19]and Akyildirim et al.[20]demonstrated the application of machine learning in forecasting Bitcoin prices and mid-price movement of Bitcoin futures, respectively. These studies highlight the ability of machine learning to harness vast datasets and identify complex patterns, enhancing predictive accuracy beyond traditional statistical approaches.

Moreover, some studies have demonstrated the effectiveness of combining machine learning techniques with blockchain data for cryptocurrency price forecasting. For example, Martin et al.[21]introduced a hybrid method that merges diverse data and analytical techniques, enhancing accuracy in this complex field. Liu et al.[22]focused on optimizing performance and interpretability in financial time series, showcasing the benefits of combining various machine learning approaches. He et al.[23]developed a deep learning ensemble model for financial time series forecasting, applicable to cryptocurrencies, illustrating the increased reliability and accuracy of multiple deep learning[24]strategies.

Additionally, Nazareth and Reddy[8]reviewed machine learning in finance, highlighting hybrid models’ effectiveness in handling financial market complexities. Further research by Nagula and Alexakis[25], Petrovic et al.[26], Gupta and Nalavade[27], and Luo et al.[28]underscores the success of diverse computational techniques in improving Bitcoin price predictions, advancing sophisticated, accurate models for cryptocurrency investments.

In conclusion, machine learning not only excels in predictive accuracy but also in adaptability and scalability, both of which are essential as the cryptocurrency market evolves. With the capacity to update models with new data, machine learning remains a vital tool for cryptocurrency trading and investment, ensuring timely and precise forecasts[19,20].

Unlike existing studies, our work introduces a novel machine learning strategy that leverages the XGBoost regressor model, combining a range of technical indicators such as EMA and MACD with historical data for Bitcoin price prediction. This approach emphasizes the use of regularization techniques to prevent overfitting and fine-tuning model parameters for enhanced accuracy. Our methodology stands out by effectively integrating diverse datasets and analytical techniques, ensuring robust and precise predictions in the highly volatile cryptocurrency market.

SECTION: III-AData Collection and Preprocessing

We obtained Bitcoin historical market data from Binance via the Binance API[29]. The dataset spans from February 1, 2021, to February 1, 2022, with a time interval of 15 minutes (minutes). This interval was chosen for its balance between capturing detailed market fluctuations and maintaining accuracy. The data is split into 80% for the training set and 20% for the testing set. The choice of a shorter time interval is particularly important due to the high volatility of the Bitcoin market, where rapid changes are frequent. In such highly volatile markets, shorter intervals are essential for accurately capturing these swift price movements, unlike in less volatile markets where longer intervals might suffice.

Figure1illustrates the Bitcoin close price over time in USD. The x-axis represents dates, while the y-axis represents the price in USD. The plot provides a visual representation of the fluctuation in Bitcoin’s closing price over the observed period, enabling insights into the cryptocurrency’s price trend and volatility.

In this section, we elaborate on the various features incorporated in this case study, employing both historical market data and technical indicators.

In historical data analysis, we utilize various metrics to understand the behavior of Bitcoin prices within specific time periods. These metrics include:

Open price (): The initial price of Bitcoin at the beginning of a specific time period.

Highest price (): The maximum price of Bitcoin recorded during a time period.

Lowest price (): The minimum price of Bitcoin recorded during a time period.

Close price (): The final price of Bitcoin at the end of a time period.

Trading volume (): The total number of Bitcoin traded within a time period.

Quote Asset Volume (QAV): The total trading value of Bitcoin within a time period.

Number of Trades (NOT): The total number of trades executed during a time period.

Total Buy Base Volume (TBBV): The total volume of Bitcoin bought during a time period.

Total Buy Quote Volume (TBQV): The total value of Bitcoin bought during a time period.

Technical analysis indicators represent a trading discipline utilized to assess investments and pinpoint trading opportunities through the analysis of statistical trends derived from trading activities, including price movements and volume[30]. In this study, we explore indicators to feed our machine learning model, such as EMA, MACD, relative strength index, momentum, price rate of change, and stochastic oscillator.

We employ EMA with different periods, where,, andrepresent the average price of Bitcoin over the last 10, 30, and 200 periods, respectively. To measure the magnitude of recent price changes and evaluate overbought or oversold conditions, we use RSI. Specifically,,,, andassess price changes over 10, 14, 30, and 200 periods, respectively. In addition, we apply Momentum (MOM) indicators to gauge the rate of change in Bitcoin prices, withandreflecting changes over the last 10 and 30 periods, respectively.

Furthermore, we incorporate MACD, a trend-following momentum indicator that illustrates the relationship between two moving averages of Bitcoin prices. Additionally, we use %K10, %K30, and %K200 as components of the stochastic oscillator, which compare the current price of Bitcoin to its price range over the last 10, 30, and 200 periods, respectively. Finally, we include the Percentage Rate of Change with 9 periods (), measuring the percentage change in Bitcoin prices over the last 9 periods.

The best combination of hyperparameters for the XGBoost model was selected based on the smallest RMSE, resulting in enhanced predictive performance. The chosen parameters are as follows:

Finally, the RMSE achieved with this parameter combination is the smallest observed during the hyperparameter tuning process.

SECTION: VResults and Analysis

In this section, we provide simulations-based evaluations of the proposed machine learning model. In particular, we compute the Mean Absolute Error (MAE), RMSE, and R-squared ().

MAE provides a simple and straightforward interpretation of the average absolute deviation between the predicted and actual values. It is easy to understand and is less sensitive to outliers compared to other metrics like RMSE.

RMSE provides a measure of the average magnitude of prediction errors in the same units as the target variable. It penalizes larger errors more heavily than MAE, making it particularly useful when large errors are undesirable.

whereis the mean of the actual values of the target variable.

Score provides an indication of how well the model fits the data relative to a simple baseline model (e.g., a model that always predicts the mean). It ranges from 0 to 1, where higher values indicate a better fit.score is widely used for comparing different models and assessing overall model performance.

TableIIIpresents key evaluation metrics for our regression model. The RMSE is 59.9504, indicating the square root of the average squared difference between predicted and actual values. The MAE is 46.2229, indicating the average absolute difference between predicted and actual values. The model’sScore is 0.9999, reflecting an exceptionally strong fit to the data. Overall, the model demonstrates high accuracy and predictive capability, with low errors and a near-perfectscore.

Another way to assess the performance of the XGBoost Regressor model is to analyze the relationship between the predicted values and the residuals. Letbe the true target values from the test dataset,be the predicted target values from the model, andbe the residuals calculated as.

Figure2shows a scatter plot of the residuals against the predicted values. The plot displays the relationship between the predicted values (scaled by 1000) and the residuals (scaled by 10). A horizontal dashed line atindicates perfect prediction, where residuals are centered around zero. The plot illustrates the model’s ability to predict accurately across the range of predicted values.

Furthermore, Figure3presents a scatter plot depicting the comparison between predicted values (in 1000s) and actual values (in 1000s). The diagonal dashed red line represents ideal prediction, where actual values align perfectly with predicted values. This plot offers insight into the model’s efficacy across the spectrum of actual values, showcasing its predictive performance.
